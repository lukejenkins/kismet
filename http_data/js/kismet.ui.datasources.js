/* ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * celldiag operator stats panel
 *
 * The one rule this panel exists to obey: unreported must never render as
 * zero.
 *
 * The helper -> C stats path is careful about this: a key with no value is
 * omitted from the JSON rather than sent as ("", 0), because "rawlog_bytes: 0"
 * reads as "tee on, nothing written" and "inventory_unrecognized: 0" reads as
 * "every code recognised" -- both the opposite of the truth.
 *
 * That omission does not survive the trip to the browser. Kismet's tracker
 * serialises every registered field whether or not the source ever set it, so
 * an omitted key arrives here as the field's default: "" or 0. The distinction
 * therefore has to be re-derived JS-side, from sentinels that are actually
 * unambiguous:
 *
 *   rawlog_path === ""                 -> no tee was ever configured. A
 *                                         configured tee always resolves to a
 *                                         path, so the empty string cannot mean
 *                                         anything else. Do not read
 *                                         rawlog_bytes at all in this state.
 *   rawlog_active === 0, path !== ""   -> a tee that was configured and is
 *                                         stopped. `rawlog=off` closes the sink
 *                                         and keeps the path on purpose, so the
 *                                         operator can still find the file --
 *                                         which means the path answers "where
 *                                         did the bytes go?" and never "is it
 *                                         writing?". Reading the path for
 *                                         liveness would make this control a
 *                                         one-way toggle: once stopped, only
 *                                         "Stop tee" would ever render again.
 *   inventory_distinct_codes === 0     -> no census has counted anything yet.
 *                                         Any record at all creates a (code,
 *                                         version) key, so a census that has
 *                                         seen data reports >= 1. Its
 *                                         unrecognized/silent companions are
 *                                         meaningless until then and are not
 *                                         rendered.
 *   native_total_records === 0         -> the native shadow tap is off (the
 *                                         baseline build, which is the shipping
 *                                         configuration). Coverage is a ratio;
 *                                         rendering a numerator without its
 *                                         denominator is how a fraction becomes

 *
 * This control deliberately does not report its own success. Three
 * independent reasons:
 *
 * 1. A refused setting comes back with `success = 1`. The framework maps only a
 *    negative chancontrol_cb return to failure on the wire, and a negative
 *    return also sets `spindown` -- so reporting a typo through the status code
 *    would end a running wardrive. celldiag returns 0 and puts the reason in
 *    the message. A control that rendered the HTTP status would show every
 *    rejection as applied.
 * 2. The reason cannot reach us over HTTP anyway. `datasourcetracker.cc`'s
 *    set_channel route takes `(t, success, e)` from the completion callback and
 *    keeps only `success` -- `e`, the message, is discarded before the response
 *    is built. There is no field to read.
 * 3. What the reason does reach is the Kismet message bus, as a MSGFLAG_ERROR
 *    line (capture-side cf_send_message -> kis_datasource::handle_msg_proxy ->
 *    _MSG), which the operator already has open.
 *
 * So the control confirms itself from the fields instead: `rawlog_path` and
 * `rawlog_bytes` are re-reported on every stats interval, and the row above
 * renders them live. A tee that actually started shows a path and a rising byte
 * count within one interval; one that was refused does not change. That is a

/* The mask-preset selector.
 *
 * Why this is not the rawlog toggle with a different string: `mask=` is
 * declined at runtime by the capture binary. Applying it re-issues a
 * LOG_CONFIG / SET_ALL_RT_MASKS handshake to the modem, on the same DIAG fd
 * `capture_thread` is blocked reading, from the framework's command thread. So
 * it is a bring-up option, and changing it means the source really does go
 * down and come back.
 *
 * close_source + open_source alone cannot do it. `open_source.cmd` re-opens
 * with `ds->get_source_definition()`, the string the source already has, so
 * close-then-reopen faithfully restores the same mask. The
 * `update_definition.cmd` route this posts to changes the definition, driving
 * parse_source_definition's folding of source_override_opts.
 *
 * Sequence: close_source -> update_definition -> open_source. The close must
 * be first. The route refuses a running source (`get_source_running()` ->
 * 500, "close_source first, then update_definition, then open_source"), so an
 * update-first chain fails on its very first call, and jQuery's `.then()` only
 * chains on resolve: the close and the open never happen.
 *
 * The reopen is `.always()`, not `.then()`. Closing first means the source is
 * down when the call that can fail is made (a rejected option, a source that
 * vanished). A reopen chained on success would leave the operator's capture
 * down and -- since this control reads nothing from the transport -- silent,
 * which is strictly worse than the button doing nothing. The invariant is "the
 * source always comes back up", and the sticky override from an earlier
 * successful Apply survives it.
 *
 * The steps chain because they are ordered -- you cannot update before the
 * close completes -- but the outcome is still not read from the transport. As
 * with the rawlog control, the answer is the `mask_preset` field re-reported
 * one row above on the next stats interval, which is the binary saying what it
 * actually armed ("wardrive", "full", "wardrive+f3", "passive") rather than

/* The F3 severity selector.
 *
 * Same route and same three-step sequence as the mask selector above, because

 * `runtime = 0`, and its decline text says applying one means re-issuing
 * SET_ALL_RT_MASKS on the DIAG fd `capture_thread` is blocked reading.
 *
 * It is not a copy of the mask control, in one way that matters and one that
 * is worth stating:
 *
 * 1. The compare is equality, not `startsWith`. `mask_preset` is a decorated
 *    label -- the binary appends "+f3" / "+f3:error" and reports "passive"
 *    under nomask= -- which is the whole reason that control matches on a
 *    prefix. `f3_preset` is the resolved preset name, one of exactly
 *    `off|all|high|error` (capture_cell_diag.c: `sx->f3_preset = ...`), with
 *    one possible decoration: `<preset>+norelay`, a preset the modem armed
 *    while the bridge has no `--f3`, so nothing reaches the message bus. The
 *    selector removes exactly that suffix and then compares by equality.
 *    Without that, no option matches `high+norelay`, the browser shows `off`
 *    as armed, and Apply restarts the source even for the preset already
 *    armed. The row above keeps the decoration, which is the operator's honest
 *    readout. `startsWith` would also pass today, since no preset is a prefix
 *    of another, but only by coincidence. The equality is the claim being
 *    made.
 *
 * 2. Applying this changes the row above too. F3 arming is what decorates
 *    `mask_preset`, so moving off->high renders "wardrive" as "wardrive+f3:high"
 *    one interval later. That is the binary reporting accurately, not the mask
 *    selector losing its value.
 *
 * The offered set is the canonical spellings only. The binary also accepts
 * `none` as an alias, and canonicalises it to `off` on the way out
 * (`f3_preset_lookup`), so offering both would put two options in the list that
 * can never be told apart in the report.
 *
 * `all` is a firehose -- millions of records in a real capture -- so its
 * confirmation says so. The presets are subtractive from `all`, and the
 * retention figures are measured on real captures, not inferred from the
 * names.
 *
 * As with the mask selector: close_source first (the route refuses a running
 * source), the reopen is `.always()` so a rejected update cannot leave the
 * source down, the calls chain because they are ordered, and they still report
 * nothing from the transport. A refused celldiag setting returns success=1,
 * so the outcome is `f3_preset`, re-reported one row up on the next stats
 * interval.
 *
 * Unlike `mask_preset`, this one is verifiable offline: `f3_preset` is
 * resolved before the live/replay split in `capture_cell_diag.c`, so a
 * `replay=` source reports it honestly (a replay source hard-codes
 * `mask_preset` to the literal "replay"). That lets this shared route be

 *
 * Why there is no enable or disable button here: `update_datasource2` builds

 * celldiag-specific duplicates would give an operator two controls for one
 * action that can disagree about which is lit. Only restart is absent.
 *
 * A restart is not "click Close, then click Activate". Those are two
 * independent async requests; by hand there is nothing that makes the open wait
 * for the close, so an operator who clicks quickly re-opens against a source
 * that is still tearing down its helper and its DIAG fd. Chaining on the
 * responses is the entire value of this control -- the ordering, not the
 * clicking.
 *
 * It is deliberately the same sequence the mask and F3 selectors already end
 * with, minus the definition update. Not new machinery: the existing restart
 * exposed without a config change, so there is one code path for "take the
 * source down and bring it back" rather than two that can drift.
 *
 * Offered only while the source is running. Restarting something that is not
 * running is an Activate, and that button already exists two rows down; worse,
 * on a source the operator explicitly Disabled it would quietly undo that.
 *
 * Reports nothing from the transport, same rule as the selectors: the outcome
 * is `kismet.datasource.running` plus celldiag's own `helper_alive` and
 * `mask_preset`, re-reported on the next stats interval. A helper that fails to
 * respawn shows as helper=DEAD in the first row, which is the measurement. */

 *

 * as zero. The helper omits what it has not measured, but every registered
 * field still arrives here as its default ("" / 0), so absence is re-derived
 * from sentinels that cannot mean anything else:
 *
 *   stats_epoch === 0          -> no stats line yet. Nothing below it is a
 *                                 measurement; render one "not reported" row
 *                                 and stop, rather than a table of zeros.
 *   state === "disabled"       -> enabled=false: no port was opened. Render a
 *                                 neutral "disabled", never counters -- a row
 *                                 of zeros reads as "running and seeing
 *                                 nothing".
 *   atlog_path === ""          -> no atlog= tee was ever configured. Do not read
 *                                 atlog_records in this state.
 *   atlog_active === 0, path   -> a tee that ran and was stopped; the path is
 *                                 kept so the operator can find the file.
 *   last_obs_epoch === 0       -> no observation yet.
 *   anchor_last_epoch === 0    -> no clock anchor yet (the modem has not
 *                                 answered AT+CCLK?).
 *   obs_total === 0            -> the rate is not rendered: a rate over zero
 *                                 observations says nothing a count does not.
 *
 * Staleness is not absence. A stats line older than ~3 intervals means the
 * helper stopped reporting, which during a full band scan is expected (the scan
 * holds the AT port -- and the helper's only thread -- for up to 3 minutes).
 * The helper announces a scan before it blocks (state "full_scan" +
