"""The Telit PCI join exists, and the default strategy switches it off.

## Background

On a Telit the two fast-cadence AT sources share no identity field:

| source | cadence | PLMN | TAC | CID | PCI |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ``AT#RFSTS`` / ``AT#SERVINFO`` | 2 s | yes | yes | yes | absent |
| ``AT#MONI`` row 1 (the same physical cell) | 5 s | no | no | no | yes |

``phy_cell``'s ``pci_promotion()`` needs a PCI on the full-identity
observation, so on a Telit that observation never has one and the two devices
are neither merged nor linked (``related=[]`` on both, where an equivalent
Quectel run links them reciprocally).

``capture_cell_at.c`` has a cached-PCI injection block that copies
``local->cached_pci`` into every RFSTS observation that lacks one. But
``cached_pci`` has exactly one writer, inside the ``AT#CSURVC`` full-scan
block, and that block is gated on ``fullscan_interval_ms > 0``, which the
default wardrive strategy sets to ``0``. So in the default profile the
injection is unreachable and the duplicate is permanent by configuration.

``AT#MONI`` never writes ``cached_pci``: the neighbor block (the ``has_moni``
branch of ``capture_cell_at.c``) only parses rows into observations, even though
the injection site was designed with MONI as a second producer. That is why the
gap reads as a Telit quirk rather than as a switched-off feature.

## What this module drives

A ``FakeAtModem`` answering as a Telit LM960A18, with a transcript recorded
from a real LM960A18: serving cell PLMN 310/260, TAC ``2D18`` = 11544, CID
``3089F02`` = 50896642, EARFCN 66786, PCI 236. ``AT#CSURVC`` binds all of it in
one line; ``#RFSTS`` omits the PCI; ``#MONI`` reports the PCI and nothing else
identifying.

Two runs, same responder, one option different:

* ``strategy=wardrive`` (the default) → the serving observation must carry no
  PCI, while a MONI observation in the same run carries 236. The second half is
  what makes this a statement about the join rather than about missing data.
* ``strategy=stationary`` → ``#CSURVC`` runs, ``cached_pci`` is written, and a
  later serving observation carries 236.

The wardrive expectation is not an assertion that the current behaviour is
correct. It pins the config gate so that a future fix (making ``#MONI`` row 1 a
verified second producer) has to come with a deliberate edit here, rather than
silently flipping a documented behaviour.
