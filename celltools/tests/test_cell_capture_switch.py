"""The capture switch and the disabled rendering, structurally.

``test_cellat_server_controls.py`` proves the ROUTE sequence works against
a real server. This file pins that the panel actually USES that sequence, and
the ways it must not deviate:

* the close comes FIRST and the reopen is ``.always()`` (if the update goes
  first, the route refuses a running source and a ``.then()`` reopen never
  chains -- a dead button);
* it never calls ``disable_source.cmd`` -- that is Kismet's OTHER "off", and a
  second control for it would disagree with the Active row's buttons;
* it reads nothing from the transport (a refused update still answers);
* celldiag's disabled branch runs BEFORE the helper row, which is the row that
  would otherwise render a disabled source as "DEAD".

Structural: these read the panel's source. The behavioural half runs against a
real server in ``test_cellat_server_controls.py``.
