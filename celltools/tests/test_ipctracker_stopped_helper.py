"""The server's child reaper tells a STOPPED helper from a DEAD one.

## The hazard

``ipc_tracker_v2`` reaps helpers with ``waitpid(-1, &status, WNOHANG |
WUNTRACED)``. ``WUNTRACED`` also reports a child that has merely STOPPED. A
reaper that treats every report as a death drops the pid from ``ipc_map`` and
tells the source ``Process exited with status {WEXITSTATUS(status)}``, which for
a stopped child is the stop signal: a helper SIGSTOPped during a
``close_source`` reads ``closed cleanly (Process exited with status 19)`` while
it sits in state T, untracked, where no SIGTERM or hard kill from the server
reaches it again.

``WEXITSTATUS`` also misreports a signal death: for a SIGKILLed child it is 0,
so the helper would read ``Process exited with status 0``.

## What is pinned

* Against a real server: a SIGSTOPped helper is not reported closed, stays alive
  and tracked, and its close completes normally once it is SIGCONTed.
* Against real wait statuses from forked children, through
  ``ipctracker_child_status.h``: an exit reads ``exited with status N``, a
  signal death ``killed by signal N``, and a stop is not an end.

Why the death TEXT is not measured through the server: a helper that dies
closes its IPC pipe as it goes, and the source sees that EOF -- event-driven --
before the reaper's 1 s timer reaps the pid, so the source reports ``IPC
connection closed`` and the reaper finds the pid already gone. The reaper's text reaches
an operator only when the pipe stays open, which is the stop case above.
