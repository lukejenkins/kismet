"""Source-agnostic offline driver for a Kismet capture binary.

## Why this is its own module

The driver fork/execs a capture binary and speaks just enough of the Kismet
``kismet_external`` **v3** datasource protocol to open a source and collect
what it relays. Every offline ``nativedecode=``, ``f3=``, ``rawlog=`` and
inventory test of the celldiag helper runs through it, and so does every
offline test of cellat's open path (for example, that ``atport=`` with a
mismatched IMEI is refused).

Nothing in the driver is celldiag-specific. It speaks the datasource IPC
protocol, not anything about DIAG: the framing, the msgpack subset, the
mandatory PING keepalive and the OPENREPORT/MESSAGE/ERROR collection are all
properties of *being a Kismet capture binary*. Source-specific routing, such
as splitting celldiag's ``diag_stats`` control objects out of the observation
relay, goes through an override point (:meth:`CaptureRun._on_json`).

So this module holds the protocol and :class:`CaptureRun`; ``CellDiagRun``
subclasses it for the ``diag_stats`` split, and ``CellAtRun`` (in
``test_cellat_ipc.py``) subclasses it for nothing at all.

## Why a capture source needs an offline harness at all

The typical failure mode of a capture source is **silence** — a source that
stops emitting looks exactly like "no cells in range". Without an offline
harness, the only alternatives are unit-testing extracted helpers or running
against real hardware.

## Wire spec

All resolved against this tree's ``kis_external_packet.h`` /
``capture_framework.c``:

* frame header = 20 bytes, big-endian, ``>IHHIHHI``:
  signature ``0xDECAFBAD``, v3_sentinel ``0xA9A9``, v3_version ``3``,
  length (payload only), pkt_type, code, seqno; msgpack map payload follows.
* pkt_type: PING=2 PONG=3 SHUTDOWN=4 MESSAGE=5 ERROR=6 OPENREQ=12
  OPENREPORT=13 PACKET=16.
* OPENREQ payload: ``{1: "<definition>"}`` (seqno in the header).
* PACKET payload: ``{5: {1:"<klass>", 2:ts_s, 3:ts_us, 4:<json>}}`` — the
  relayed JSON is at ``map[5][4]``. A raw packet (``cf_send_data``) is instead
  ``{4: {1:dlt, 2:ts_s, 3:ts_us, 4:length, 6:<bin content>}}``.
* PING keepalive is mandatory: a capture binary FATAL-exits if it sees no frame
  for >15 s, so the harness pings while pumping.
