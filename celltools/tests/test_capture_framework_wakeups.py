"""The capture framework's output-ring signalling: two wakeups that must not be lost.

Every ``kismet_cap_*`` helper hands its frames to ``capture_framework.c``'s
output ring and lets the framework's I/O thread write them to Kismet. Two
signals cross that ring:

**Helper -> I/O thread ("there is something to write").** ``cf_handler_loop()``
builds its write set *before* it blocks in ``select()`` for up to 500 ms, so
without an explicit wakeup a frame committed while it is parked sits in the
ring until the timeout or an unrelated server frame. Every frame would pay
0-500 ms of latency, and at a Kismet stop (pipe close + SIGTERM, no teardown)
whatever was still waiting would be lost: the last ~0.5-1 s of a live stream.

**I/O thread -> helper ("the ring has room again").**
``cf_handler_wait_ringbuffer()`` must wait on the flush condvar under its mutex
and with a predicate. Otherwise a flush that finishes between the caller's
failed send and its wait leaves it parked until some unrelated write
broadcasts again. On the celldiag and cellat helpers that caller is the thread
reading the modem.

The probe's modes and what a lost wakeup looks like in each:

====================  ==========================================================
commit-latency        every frame waits out the 500 ms select timeout
                      (lockstep: a source that commits just after each flush
                      always waits out the remainder). Woken: ~100 us.
wait-after-flush      the caller parks until the unrelated broadcast the probe
                      sends at 1 s. Woken: ~0.1 ms.
race                  callers still parked 50 ms after the flush finished.
                      Woken: none.
====================  ==========================================================

A third hazard sits in the same loop: a ``write()`` failing with EAGAIN/EINTR
must not fall through to a consume of ``(size_t) -1`` bytes, which would
discard the whole ring. It is pinned here by fault injection.

The probe (``cf_wakeup_probe.c``) links the tree's ``libkismetdatasource.a`` and
drives the framework's public calls directly: no server, no capture source, no
modem. The last two tests drive the real celldiag binary through the IPC
harness.
