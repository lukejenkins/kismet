"""The capture profiles' ``diag.target_codes`` must not drift from the code.

Every ``capture_cell_at/profiles/*.json`` carries a ``diag.target_codes`` list,
and every one of their ``diag.notes`` says the list mirrors ``DIAG_TARGET_CODES``
in ``capture_cell_diag/diag_config.c``, naming that file "the single source of
truth". This module enforces that claim; without it, a code added to the C array
(the GNSS codes ``0x1476`` / ``0x14D8``, for example) leaves every profile stale.

**Why the drift is worse than it looks.** ``target_codes`` is not read at runtime —
the helper subscribes ``DIAG_TARGET_CODES`` and narrows it with
``diag_config_filter_supported`` against the modem's own advertised ranges.
So a stale list changes no behaviour, which is exactly why it can rot unnoticed
while remaining the first thing a human reads to answer "what does this modem
capture?". It is documentation whose whole value is being accurate, with no failure
mode to announce when it is not.

The invariants asserted here are deliberately not "every profile lists every code":

* **subset** — a profile may legitimately list FEWER codes than the C array. The
  EG25-G (MDM9207) and LM960 (SDX20) have no NR radio, so ``0xB821`` / ``0xB97F``
  never fire on them and listing those would be its own inaccuracy.
* **union** — but across the fleet every code in ``DIAG_TARGET_CODES`` must be
  claimed by at least one profile, or a code was added to the C array and no
  profile ever documented which hardware it is for.
* **no invention** — a profile may not list a code that is NOT in the C array. That
  is the drift direction that actively misleads: it reads as capture coverage the
  helper never subscribes to.

Skips only when ``KP_ROOT`` was pointed at something that is not a source
tree. It does not skip on a missing/unparseable source: a guard that skips when
it cannot find the thing it guards silently stops guarding.
