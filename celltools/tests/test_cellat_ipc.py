"""Offline IPC harness for the Kismet ``kismet_cap_cell_at`` capture binary.

The AT-side counterpart to ``test_celldiag_replay_ab.py``. Drives the compiled
capture binary end to end — real ``open_callback``, real ``identify_modem``, real
``serial_open``/``at_command`` out of ``at_serial.inc`` — against a
:class:`fake_at_modem.FakeAtModem` on a pseudo-terminal, with no modem and no
running Kismet server.

## What this covers

``atport=`` is an explicit AT-port override. Kismet accepts unknown source
options silently, so an option that is parsed but not honoured looks like it
works. The option scanner is unit-tested in ``test_cellat_options``; this file
tests the open path, where the behaviour that matters lives: an ``atport=``
pointing at the wrong modem must fail, not survey it.

## The two failure modes this is aimed at

1. **Surveying the wrong modem under the right IMEI.** Auto-detect's only safety
   property is that it matches on IMEI. An override that merely opened the named
   path would discard that, and every observation's ``prov.imei`` would name a
   modem that produced none of it.
   ``test_atport_refuses_a_modem_with_a_different_imei`` is the pin.
2. **Silence.** A capture source that emits nothing looks exactly like "no cells
   in range". Every test here asserts on what the modem actually received
   (``modem.commands``), not only on what the helper reported, so a run that
   reports success while opening some other port cannot pass.

Scope: this harness verifies dialogue and control flow. It does not verify
cell-report decode; the fake modem has no cell state (see ``fake_at_modem``).

## Every test here must pass ``atport=``

Without ``atport=``, ``open_callback`` falls through to ``find_port_by_imei()``,
which scans every serial port on the host. On a workstation with real modems
attached, a test that omits ``atport=`` opens live hardware and sends it AT
commands, and the suite slows from about a second to minutes.

The malformed-IMEI tests are the deliberate exception: cellat validates the
IMEI's shape before it touches any port, so those never reach the scan.

## Negative controls

Each mutation below, applied to the C source, should fail the listed tests. A
control that fails nothing means the test does not test what it claims:

===================================================  ================================
mutation                                             result
===================================================  ================================
``atport=`` IMEI ``strcmp`` deleted                   1 fails: the refusal test
``if (atport_override[0])`` → ``if (0)``              6 fail (and the suite crawls)
unknown-option callback never invoked                 1 fails: the warning test
``"atport"`` removed from the known-options list      1 fails: the control test
===================================================  ================================

The last two are opposite halves of one feature and fail different tests: a
warning nobody checks the negative of will eventually fire on options that
work, and then be ignored.
