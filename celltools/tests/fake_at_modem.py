"""A PTY-backed scripted AT responder, so cellat's open path is testable.

## Why this exists

``capture_cell_diag`` can be driven offline because DIAG is a **byte stream**: a
``replay=<file>`` option hands the helper a recorded capture and everything
downstream is real code on real bytes. ``capture_cell_at`` cannot be driven that
way, because AT is a **request/response dialogue** — there is nothing to replay,
only something to answer, so cellat needs a live responder to be tested offline.

A pseudo-terminal provides one. The harness holds the **master**; the capture binary
opens the **slave** path exactly as it would open ``/dev/ttyUSB2``, including the
real ``serial_open`` → ``tcsetattr`` → ``poll``-driven ``at_command`` path in
``at_serial.inc``. Nothing in the binary is stubbed, mocked or conditionally
compiled: the only fiction is which process is on the other end of the wire.

## What it deliberately does NOT model

This is not a modem simulator, and a test must not read it as one. It
answers the commands it was handed and returns ``ERROR`` to everything else. It
carries no cell state, no registration state, and no timing behaviour beyond
the delays a test scripts explicitly with ``pace=`` — so it can
verify *dialogue and control flow* (which port got opened, which commands were
sent to it, what the helper did with the answers) and it can NOT verify decode of
a real modem's cell reports. Those need real captures and real hardware.

A silent responder is a first-class case, not a degenerate one. A DIAG port
and an NMEA port both exist, are openable, and never answer ``AT`` — that is
precisely how a typo'd ``atport=`` fails in the field, so ``silent=True`` is what
pins the "did not respond to AT identification" branch.

## Usage

    :param imei: answered to ``AT+CGSN`` — the value cellat's ``atport=`` override
        re-verifies against the source definition's IMEI.
    :param firmware: answered to ``AT+CGMR``. ``identify_modem`` FAILS on an empty
        firmware, so a modem that answers ``AT`` but has no ``+CGMR`` is a real
        rejection path, reachable by passing ``firmware=""``.
    :param manufacturer: answered to ``AT+CGMI``; drives ``detect_vendor``.
    :param extra: additional ``{command: response_body}`` pairs, matched exactly
        after stripping the trailing ``\\r``/``\\n``.
    :param silent: answer nothing at all — models a DIAG or NMEA port.
    :param unknown_response: what an unscripted command gets. ``ERROR`` is what a
        real modem sends; ``None`` means "no answer", i.e. let it time out.
    :param hang: commands answered with NOTHING, even if scripted -- the helper
        waits out that command's own timeout. Models a long network scan
        (``AT+QSCAN=3,1`` blocks the capture thread up to 120 s) without making
        every other unscripted command time out too, which is what
        ``unknown_response=None`` would do.
    :param pace: ``{command: (think_s, transfer_s)}``. The answer to a paced
        command starts ``think_s`` after the command arrives, and its terminal
        line (``OK``/``ERROR``) follows the rest ``transfer_s`` later -- a
        known think-time and transfer time for the RawAT instants to be
        measured against. Unpaced commands answer at once.
    :param echo: echo every command line back before answering, as a real
        modem does until ``ATE0``. Off by default;
        an echo arrives before any think-time, which is what a test of "the
        echo does not start the response" needs on the wire.
    :param unterminated: commands answered with their value and NO final
        ``OK`` -- what a Foxconn T99W175 does for every info read (AT+CGMR /
        +CGSN / +CGMI / +CGMM). Without this the responder
        appends ``OK`` to every answer, so the shape could not be built.
    :param sequence: ``{command: [first_body, second_body, ...]}`` -- successive
        answers to the SAME command, consumed in order; once exhausted, the
        command falls back to its ordinary script. Models a reply that is wrong
        once and right on the retry, e.g. a stale ``AT+CGMI`` line taken as the
        ``AT+CGSN`` answer. Stateful: ``response_for`` consumes it.
