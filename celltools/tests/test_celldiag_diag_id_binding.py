"""A qsh=on capture carries the modem's DIAGID-table reply in its stream.

``qsh=on`` asks the modem for its diag_id binding table (``0x4B 12 22 02 01``)
at bring-up. The bring-up's handshake reader consumes the reply, so unless it
relays the frame, the reply reaches neither the ``rawlog=`` tee nor the DLT-147
raw packets and an offline decode of the capture finds an empty binding (the
RM500Q-AE and RM520N-GL answer ``{1: APPS, 2: mdm/modem/root_pd}``). An HDLC
walk reads the binding from any in-stream reply frame, so the capture relays
the frame into the stream.

These run the REAL capture binary against a PTY DIAG responder that answers the
request with an SDX55-shaped table. No host port is touched.
