"""celldiag counts the DIAG frames that fail CRC, in every mode, and says so
when a stream is losing bytes.

A USB-serial DIAG stream can lose byte runs (for example when the read loop
blocks on a slow decoder's pipe during a burst). Every other integrity check
on the Kismet path still passes, because the kismetdb faithfully holds what the
helper read; a frame that fails CRC is the only trace. So the helper counts
CRC failures in every mode, records the census, and raises an error when the
damage crosses a floor.

These tests drive the real binary over the datasource IPC with replays whose
damage is known exactly: a byte run cut from the middle of a frame, which is
how real loss presents (the damaged frame's length disagrees with its header).
The delimiter survives, so the frame count does not change and each cut is
exactly one CRC-bad frame.

The clean replay is the positive control. A census that never counts
anything would pass every "no alert" assertion vacuously, so the clean run must
show every frame CHECKED, and the damaged runs must show the exact count cut.
