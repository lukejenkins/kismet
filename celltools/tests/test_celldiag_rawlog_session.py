"""A reopen never shrinks a ``rawlog=`` tee -- one tee per capture session.

Every reopen of a celldiag source (a restart-to-apply toggle, the whole-modem
switch, Kismet's automatic error reopen) is a new helper process. If each one
opened the tee ``O_TRUNC``, a fixed ``rawlog=`` path would silently hold only
the last session beside a kismetdb holding all of them. A session that finds
the path already holding an earlier session diverts to a stamped sibling and
says so.

These tests drive the REAL binary over the datasource IPC in replay mode, the
same path a live source's tee takes (the open-time ``rawlog=`` sink is opened by
the capture thread for replay and live alike). Each session replays DIFFERENT
bytes, so "the file equals session N's input" can only be true of the file that
session wrote.

The assertions are on content, not on the diverted file names: sessions run
back to back can share a UTC second, and the name then counts (``-2``) rather
than stamps. The C unit test (``test_diag_rawlog.c``) pins the naming.
