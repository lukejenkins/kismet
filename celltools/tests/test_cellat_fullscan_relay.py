"""Full-scan observations must reach Kismet regardless of ``debug=``.

## The hazard

``capture_cell_at.c``'s full-scan block sends a debug-only summary message
(``if (local->debug && obs_count > 0) { ... }``) next to the ``cf_send_json``
loop that relays the observations. If that ``if`` encloses the send loop, every
observation from ``AT+QSCAN=3,1`` / ``AT#CSURVC`` is relayed only when
``debug=`` is on. The serving and neighbor blocks have the same shape, so a
misplaced closing brace here reads correctly line by line.

``debug=`` defaults ON, so such a regression shows up only for an operator who
turned debug off, which is the normal setting for a production wardrive. It is
also silent: the scan is still performed (up to a 120 s ``AT+QSCAN``), an INFO
line still says *"starting full band scan"*, and the results are dropped. Full
scan exists to find the cells the serving and neighbor queries do not report,
so its output is not redundant with anything else the source emits.

## What this test drives

A ``FakeAtModem`` reporting ``RM500Q`` firmware, which is what sets
``has_qscan``, with ``strategy=stationary`` -- the one strategy that enables
full scan (``fullscan_interval_ms = 60000``; wardrive and serving_only set it
to 0). ``fullscan_last_ms`` starts at 0 against an epoch clock, so the scan
fires on the first loop iteration rather than 60 s in.

``debug=false`` is the load-bearing part of the source definition. With debug
left at its default the test would pass even with the relay gated on debug.
