"""A part that rejects the qsh=on requests opens at once.

``qsh=on`` sends three requests at bring-up -- the QSH-trace maskset (0x4B
subsys 0x44), the event-report enable (0x60) and the diag_id binding (0x4B
subsys 0x12). A part without them answers each with DIAG_BAD_CMD_F (0x13) plus
an echo of the request. The handshake reader must take that BAD_CMD as the
answer; a reader that waits only for the request's own opcode spends the full
20 s deadline on every rejection (and again on every reopen) while the modem
streams on.

These run the REAL capture binary against a PTY DIAG responder that rejects all
three, streaming filler frames the way a live port does. No host port is touched.
