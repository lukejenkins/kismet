"""A scripted DIAG responder on a pseudo-terminal.

``fake_at_modem.FakeAtModem`` made cellat's open path testable offline; this is
its DIAG sibling. ``capture_cell_diag`` reads its DIAG port as a raw byte stream
and writes HDLC-framed commands into it, so a pty that deframes what it is sent
and answers in HDLC is, from the binary's side, indistinguishable from a modem
on ``diagport=`` -- with ``nomask=true`` there is no LOG_CONFIG handshake to
script, and ``atport=`` a :class:`FakeAtModem` supplies the AT identity.

What it answers is deliberately narrow: ``DIAG_TS_F`` (opcode ``0x1D``, empty
body), the one command a running capture issues on its own (the clock
anchor). Every other command is recorded in :attr:`commands` and ignored, like
a modem whose response is being dropped.

The reply is the real wire shape (as sent by a DW5821e / SDX20)::

    0x1D  <8-byte little-endian ts64>  <crc16 LE>  0x7E

``ts64`` here is computed from the HOST clock -- GPS time in the Q16 1.25 ms
tick (``TS64_TICK_S``) plus ``offset_s`` -- so a test can check the consumer's
UTC reprojection against a known skew rather than against the fake's own output.

It can also stream filler LOG_F frames between anchors (``filler_hz``) whose
payload deliberately carries ``0x7E`` / ``0x7D`` bytes, so the anchor has to be
fished out of a stuffed, interleaved stream exactly as it is on real hardware.
