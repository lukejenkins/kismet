"""Unit tests for the shared staleness predicate + the sync-time probe.

``test_celldiag_replay_ab.py`` FAILS when the compiled driver predates its own
sources. Whatever advances this tree -- a fetch and fast-forward, a branch
switch -- restamps exactly those source mtimes, so without a sync-time probe the
first sign is a red test that reads like a decode regression when the cause is
a stale build artifact.

The probe reports the condition where it is created. These tests pin the two
things that make it worth having:

1. **One predicate, not two.** The sync warning and the test guard both call
   ``celldiag_parity.staleness()``. If the warning re-derived "its sources"
   its own way it would eventually disagree with the guard -- and the disagreement
   that matters is *sync says current, pytest says stale*, the very confusion
   the probe exists to prevent.
2. **It stays advisory.** A sync that builds, or that fails on a stale artifact,
   would be a worse trade than the problem: a sync's nonzero exit conventionally
   means *"this checkout needs attention"* (dirty / divergent / fetch-failed),
   and a stale binary is not that.

Synthetic tree, no real build, no compiler -- so they run on every host, following
``test_celldiag_link_deps.py``'s precedent.

    """Two roles that resolve to the SAME make command collapse to one.

    The chain exists to rebuild each DISTINCT driver once. If a future role
    shared another's make target, ``make X && make X`` would be noise — and if
    dedup leaves only one distinct command there is no cascade to converge, so
    the result is ``None`` just like the lone-driver case. Pins the ``cmd not in
    cmds`` guard, which no real ROLES pair currently exercises.
