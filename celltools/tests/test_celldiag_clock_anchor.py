"""The celldiag host<->modem-ts64 clock anchor, end to end on a fake modem.

A live celldiag source asks its modem ``DIAG_TS_F`` at START, every
``clock_anchor_sec=`` and at END, and pairs each reply with the host clock as a
``type="ClockAnchor"`` row + a ``<rawlog>.clock_anchor.jsonl`` line. These tests
drive the REAL binary over the datasource IPC against two ptys --
:class:`FakeAtModem` for identity (``atport=``) and :class:`FakeDiagModem` for
DIAG (``diagport=``, ``nomask=true`` so there is no LOG_CONFIG to script) -- so
the scheduling, the in-stream reply scan, the host pairing and both delivery
paths are measured, not inferred from the unit test of the parts.

**The offset assertion is the load-bearing one.** The fake modem runs its
clock ``OFFSET_S`` ahead of the host. A row whose ``source_clock_value`` merely
round-trips the fake's reply proves the scanner works; only recovering
``OFFSET_S`` from ``(host_utc, source_clock_value)`` proves the row pairs the
modem clock with the host clock, which is the whole point of the anchor.

**The END anchor is tested on a graceful pipe close only, on purpose.** Kismet
stops a source with pipe-close + SIGTERM, and the capture framework leaves
SIGTERM at its default disposition, so a Kismet-driven stop runs no teardown at
all -- END included (see ``anchor_end`` in capture_cell_diag.c). The graceful
close is the path END is reachable on (a remote ``--connect`` capture losing its
server), and it is the path asserted here.
