"""cellat's real IMEI scan, driven offline against PTY fakes only.

## Why ``CELLAT_SCAN_PORTS``

celldiag has ``CELLDIAG_SCAN_PORTS``, which replaces its scan universe, so its
tests point the real scan at a PTY fake modem and nothing else. cellat's
``CELLAT_EXTRA_PORTS`` adds to ``/dev/ttyUSB*`` + ``/dev/ttyACM*`` + the non-USB AT
nodes, so a test built on it would write ``AT`` into every real modem on the
host. ``CELLAT_SCAN_PORTS`` is the replacing twin, and this file uses it to test
the scan's own behaviour (the open deadline, the busy-port rescan, and the
window between "found" and "opened for use") through the compiled binary with
no host tty touched.

## How "no host tty is opened" is measured, not assumed

``scan_shim.so``, compiled here and injected with ``LD_PRELOAD``, appends the path
of every ``open()`` under ``/dev/`` to ``OPEN_LOG``. Every test asserts that no
logged path is a host modem node, and the positive control asserts the log DID
record the fake's PTY -- a gauge that has never read positive cannot be read as
negative.

The same shim carries the two faults a scan meets in the field:

* ``STUCK_OPEN_PATH`` / ``STUCK_OPEN_MS`` -- ``open()`` of one path does not
  return for a while: a tty still in its final close after a sibling's probe.
* ``CLAIM_PATH`` / ``CLAIM_ON_OPEN_N`` / ``CLAIM_HOLD_MS`` -- on the Nth
  ``open()`` of the path, a forked child takes the port's exclusive ``flock``
  from outside the helper (a real second process, the same claim a sibling
  source's probe takes) and holds it for ``CLAIM_HOLD_MS``. The helper's own
  open proceeds only once the child holds the claim, so the kernel refuses the
  helper's ``flock`` with ``EWOULDBLOCK`` as it would on real hardware.

## Why the identify-to-open test needs the Nth open

cellat's scan identifies the modem on the first open of the port, releases it,
then opens it again for ongoing use. A sibling's scan can take the claim in
that window, failing the launch with ``Failed to open /dev/ttyUSB5: Resource
temporarily unavailable``. ``CLAIM_ON_OPEN_N=2`` puts a real claim exactly
there, every time.
