"""A malformed AT+CGSN read is never a confident IMEI mismatch in celldiag.

## The hazard

Taking any value line of an ``AT+CGSN`` reply as the IMEI is unsafe: a PCIe
RM520N-GL can return the modem's ``AT+CGMI`` answer (a reply another prober
left on the port), which would list it as ``cellat-Quectel``.

In celldiag the wrong value does more than mislabel a ``--list`` row. On an
IMEI-targeted open the read is compared with the wanted IMEI, and a non-empty
value that differs is a **confident** mismatch: the scan then skips every
remaining port of that USB device. A stale ``Quectel`` would make the scan
walk past the very modem it is looking for, and nothing would say why.

So a read that is not 15 ASCII digits (``modemident_imei_ok()``) is asked once
more -- the exchange flushes input first, so a stale reply is dropped -- and a
second bad read is treated as "this port did not answer": no mismatch, no
device skip, and a reason in the scan's port detail (open) or on stderr
(``--list``).

## How it is reached offline

``CELLDIAG_SCAN_PORTS`` names the scan's whole universe, so the scan
probes only the PTY fake and never a host tty. The fake's ``sequence=`` answers
``AT+CGSN`` with the stale ``Quectel`` first, then with its IMEI.

The device skip itself cannot be observed here: a PTY has no USB device id,
and the skip is keyed on one. What is observable, and is the same decision, is
that a malformed read does not end the probe of the target's own port.
