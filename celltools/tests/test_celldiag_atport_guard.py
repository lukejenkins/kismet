"""celldiag ``atport=`` guard — refuse a non-AT wwan/MHI node.

``atport=`` names the AT-identify node explicitly so celldiag
can bring up an MHI/wwan modem the ttyUSB IMEI scan cannot glob (a PCIe
RM520N-GL: AT on ``/dev/mhi_DUN``, DIAG on ``/dev/mhi_DIAG``). The hazard the
guard closes: a mistyped ``atport=/dev/mhi_DIAG`` (or ``mhi_SAHARA`` / ``mhi_QDSS``)
would make celldiag write ``ATI`` into the DIAG / EDL / trace channel. The guard
runs in ``open_callback`` as a pure ``diag_wwanport`` classification, before any
port is opened or any AT scan runs, so this test needs no modem: a rejected
open comes back as ``open_code == 0`` with the refusal message, and that is the
whole assertion.

Unlike ``test_celldiag_error_delivery``'s bogus-IMEI hazard, these definitions
are safe by construction: the guard fires on the string classification of the
atport node before the bring-up touches hardware, so nothing is probed.
