"""celldiag's first DIAG command survives junk a scanner left in the port.

## The hazard

cellat's IMEI scan writes ``AT\\r\\n`` into every tty it can claim -- a modem's
DIAG node included; only celldiag's own scan skips those. A DIAG node does not
answer AT, but its HDLC parser keeps the four bytes as the head of a frame. The
next frame to arrive -- celldiag's first command -- is glued onto them, fails
its CRC, and is never answered. On an EG25-G this leaves the SPC unlock
unanswered until its deadline; one lone ``0x7E`` after the probe clears it.

## The guard, and how this file sees it

``diag_capture_open()`` sends one lone ``0x7E`` once it holds the port's
claim: an empty frame the modem discards, which terminates whatever partial
frame was pending. ``FakeDiagModem`` behaves like the modem here -- it splits
on ``0x7E`` and drops a frame whose CRC fails -- so a scan probe written into
its port before celldiag opens it reproduces the hazard offline.

With ``nomask=true`` the first command celldiag sends is the START clock
anchor (``DIAG_TS_F``), and ``clock_anchor_sec=0`` asks for nothing after it,
so a lost first command shows as a run with no anchor at all.
