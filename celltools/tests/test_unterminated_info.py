"""A modem that never sends the final OK on info replies is identified fast.

A Foxconn T99W175 answers AT+CGMR / +CGSN / +CGMI / +CGMM with the value (in
about 50 ms) and no final ``OK``. A reader that ends an exchange only on OK /
ERROR / +CME ERROR runs every such read to its whole deadline, about 7 s per
``--list`` per unit, on every Sources-panel refresh and every open-time IMEI
scan.

The info reads end once a value line has arrived and the port has then been
idle for ``MODEMIDENT_INFO_IDLE_MS``. Two things must not change, and are pinned
here beside the speed-up:

* a well-behaved modem's dialogue -- the same commands, the same label;
* a slow modem that DOES terminate, but late: its OK must not be taken as the
  END of the next command's reply (a bare OK before any value line does not end
  an info read -- the idle gap does).

Every modem is a PTY fake reached through ``*_SCAN_PORTS``; no host tty is touched.
