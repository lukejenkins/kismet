"""``local->name`` must be assigned before anything formats it.

## The hazard

``capture_cell_at.c``'s transcript-open block passes ``local->name`` to a
``%s`` in all four of its messages. If the block runs before
``local->name = strdup(hw_desc)``, the operator sees::

    (null) AT transcript (auto) to /tmp/kismet_cellat_351234567890123.log

## Why this is a bug and not a cosmetic wart

1. **It is undefined behavior.** glibc renders ``NULL`` for ``%s`` as
   ``(null)`` as a courtesy; C does not require it and other libcs segfault.
   This tree builds on more than glibc.
2. **The name is the only per-source discriminator in the log.** Two cellat
   sources produce two identical ``(null) AT transcript (auto) to …`` lines,
   separable only by an IMEI buried in a path.
3. **It is on the debug path.** The auto branch is ``local->debug &&
   transcript_fd < 0``, which every ``debug=true`` source with no
   ``transcript=`` takes.

## Why the block sits below the assignment instead of using a ``? :`` fallback

A ternary makes the line safe while leaving it permanently less useful than
every message around it: the name would read ``unknown`` forever. Placing the
block below the assignment fixes all four sites at once and keeps the messages
as informative as their neighbours.

That placement is safe because no ``at_command_t()`` call sits between the
assignment and the block (the last before is ``ATE0``; the next after is
``AT+CPIN?``). So the transcript still opens before any AT I/O it could have
logged.

## Why the structural test reads the source

A run-based fixture reaches only the auto branch, but the explicit
``transcript=`` branch formats ``local->name`` twice more (success and
open-failure). The structural test below reads the source instead of trusting
what one run reaches.

    ``open_callback`` assigns ``local->name`` twice: once in the
