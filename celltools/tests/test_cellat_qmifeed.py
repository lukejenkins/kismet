"""cellat ``qmifeed=``: a QMI cell feed relayed as CellModem records.

``capture_cell_at/qmifeed/kismet_qmi_feed.py`` (``qmifeed=auto``) polls qmicli and writes one
build_cell_json-shaped observation per stdout line, stamped
``{"prov":{"src":"qmi",...}}``. ``qmifeed=<command>`` makes
``kismet_cap_cell_at`` spawn that command and forward each line to the server
as a ``CellModem`` record -- the record type its own AT observations ride -- so
``phy_cell`` merges QMI, AT and DIAG sightings of one tower via ``prov.src``.

What is pinned here, end to end through the compiled binary and a fake modem
(the spawn / framing / fd-hygiene / group-kill units are C-tested in
``capture_cell_at/test_cellat_qmifeed.c``):

* feed lines arrive verbatim as observations, beside the AT ones, and a
  non-JSON banner line does not;
* ``qmifeed=`` is a known option (no unknown-option "IGNORED" warning);
* a feed that exits is reported, and AT polling carries on;
* the feed does not outlive the capture child: Kismet's CLOSEREQ stop
  kills the feed's whole process group -- including a grandchild of
  ``sh -c`` -- and a capture child killed outright, which runs no teardown,
  still takes a writing feed with it (PDEATHSIG + SIGPIPE; see the layers in
  ``cellat_qmifeed.h``).

The feed is a script file, not an inline command: ``cf_find_flag`` splits the
definition on commas and ends a quoted value at the next ``"``, so a command
that prints JSON cannot be written inline. Operators hit the same rule; the
real feed's command line (``python .../kismet_qmi_feed.py --interval 5``) has
neither character.
