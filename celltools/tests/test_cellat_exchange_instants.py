"""cellat consumes the RawAT exchange instants, on the real binary.

Every RawAT row carries ``tx_done_ns`` / ``first_rx_ns`` / ``rx_done_ns``.
Two products use them:

1. **Every AT-derived observation names the exchange it came from.** Its
   ``prov`` block carries ``at_ts_mono_ns`` (the RawAT row's ``ts_mono_ns``,
   unique per exchange: the join key) and ``rx_done_ns`` (when the answer was
   complete). A corpus tool can then geotag the observation at the moment the
   modem's answer was in, instead of at SQLite-insert time. Tagged at PARSE
   time: Telit's neighbour path sends ``AT#MONI=0`` after its parse, so "the
   last exchange" at emit time would name the wrong command.
2. **The AT ClockAnchor is stamped inside its own exchange,** transport-uniform
   with the DIAG anchor: ``host_mono_ns`` / ``host_utc`` are the
   MIDPOINT of ``[tx_done, first_rx]`` of the ``AT+CCLK?`` exchange -- the
   modem read its RTC after the command left the host and before the first
   byte of its answer -- and ``host_rtt_ns`` is that window's width, so the
   anchor is wrong by at most ``host_rtt_ns / 2``. A host instant taken
   before the command is sent would leave the whole exchange as unaccounted
   uncertainty.

The modem is a PTY fake with SCRIPTED think-times, so every interval has a
value the test chose (the positive control); no host port is touched.
