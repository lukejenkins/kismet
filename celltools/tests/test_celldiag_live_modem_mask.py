"""The mask-preset round-trip, on a real modem.

**Why this cannot be done offline.** ``test_celldiag_server_routes.py``
drives the same ``update_definition`` route and measures the **F3** selector
end to end -- but a ``replay=`` source hard-codes ``mask_preset`` to the
literal ``"replay"`` (``capture_cell_diag.c``): there is no modem, so there is
no LOG_CONFIG handshake and no armed mask to report. Its
``test_a_replay_source_reports_mask_preset_as_replay_not_a_preset`` pins that
limit deliberately. The mask half needs hardware.

This file runs that bench observation as a test. It skips cleanly when no
DIAG modem is attached.

**The two negative controls, both load-bearing.**

1. The pre-switch value is asserted to be ``wardrive`` and **not** ``full``
   *before* the switch. Without that, ``await_field("mask_preset", "full")``
   would pass on a source that reported ``full`` from the start and never
   moved.
2. The preset is switched **back**. A one-way test passes against a field
   that latches on first write; only a round trip shows the control is live
   in both directions.
