"""cellat opens an unregistered Telit whose survey commands answer bare OK.

## The hazard

A Telit LM960A18 with **no serving cell** (garage, basement, antenna not yet
connected) answers ``AT#RFSTS`` / ``AT#SERVINFO`` / ``AT#MONI`` with a bare
``OK`` — the command is supported, there is simply nothing to report. If the
Telit branch of ``open_callback`` set ``has_rfsts`` only when the response
contained ``#RFSTS:``, a bare ``OK`` would count as *refused*, and with every
other Telit probe also empty the open would be refused outright with

    Modem on … does not support any known cell survey command.

A drive that **starts** without signal would then never get its Telit source,
and — because every reopen repeats the same probe — the source would never
retry into success once the modem registered (no source, no ``ClockAnchor``).

## The rule

A final ``OK`` (no ``ERROR`` / ``+CME ERROR``) from a Telit survey command
means SUPPORTED-BUT-EMPTY: the capability is set and the poll loop finds cells
once the modem registers. A real ``ERROR`` is still refused. The refusal
message names the commands the detected vendor actually probed, not the generic
auto-detect list (``AT+QENG="servingcell", AT!GSTATUS?, …``), which a Telit is
never sent.

## Scope

This is the offline half. It verifies the OPEN DECISION — the source opens
instead of being refused, and the refusal message (when a modem truly supports
nothing) names the right commands. It does NOT verify cell decode; the fake
modem carries no cell state (see ``fake_at_modem``), so that needs a real
modem.
