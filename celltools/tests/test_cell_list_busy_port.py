"""A lister waits out a port another lister is probing, briefly.

## The hazard

The server's ``list_interfaces`` runs the cellat and celldiag listers at the same
time. Each claims a port with ``flock(LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB)`` and SKIPS a port another
process holds. A modem with TWO AT ports survives that: the listers each find
a free one. The Foxconn T99W175 has ONE, so without a re-try the lister that reaches it second
would drop it, and the Sources panel would never show both of its entries.

A capture's OPEN rescans after a busy skip. A lister does the same: each lister
re-tries the ports it found busy until they are free or ONE
shared deadline (``CELL_LIST_BUSY_WAIT_MS``) passes. A lister's hold is sub-second,
so the wait ends almost at once. A port held by an OPEN capture is
held for good: it costs the deadline once per list, not once per port,
and is still skipped.

## How the listers are reached offline

``CELLAT_SCAN_PORTS`` / ``CELLDIAG_SCAN_PORTS`` REPLACE the scan universe with the
named PTYs, so no host tty is touched. The "other lister, mid-probe" is a
``flock(LOCK_EX)`` taken on the fake's slave path from this process -- the same
claim both listers take -- released on a timer.
