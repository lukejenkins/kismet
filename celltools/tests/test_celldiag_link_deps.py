"""Unit tests for the derived link-dependency set behind the staleness guard.

The guard answers *"is the binary older than its sources?"*. A directory glob
(``srcdir.glob("*.c")`` + ``"*.h"``) gets that wrong in both directions:

* Over-broad: ``capture_cell_diag/`` also holds ``celldiag_probe.c`` and the
  ``test_diag_*.c`` unit drivers, none of which are in ``MONITOR_OBJS``, so
  editing one would fail every replay test with a stale-binary error about a
  binary that is current.
* Under-broad, the more dangerous direction: ``diag_native_decode.cpp`` sits
  in that directory but is ``.cpp``, and the generated C++ decode legs
  (``DIAGSPEC_SRCS``) live in ``../diagspec/``, outside the globbed directory.
  Both are linked into ``kismet_cap_cell_diag`` via ``NATIVE_OBJS``, so editing
  a decode leg would leave the binary reading "current".

The guard therefore derives the set from the Makefile's link rule.

These tests run against the parser alone (a synthetic tree, no real build, no
compiler), so they pin the logic on every host.
