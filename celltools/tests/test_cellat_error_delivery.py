"""Post-open error reporting for ``kismet_cap_cell_at``.

## The server behaviour this works around

``cf_send_error()`` is silently discarded by the Kismet server under protocol
v3. There is no ``case KIS_EXTERNAL_V3_CMD_ERROR`` in either dispatcher:
``kis_external_interface::dispatch_rx_packet_v3`` handles MESSAGE / PING / PONG /
SHUTDOWN plus the WEB and EVT families and falls through to
``kis_datasource::dispatch_rx_packet_v3``, which handles the KDS reports and no
ERROR either. Both return ``false`` and the frame is dropped. From
``kis_datasource.cc:1084``::

    // v3 drops explicit error/warning reports and rolls them into the return
    // codes of the packet headers itself.  The error message is sent as a
    // message prior to the packet being sent.

``capture_cell_diag`` and ``capture_cell_at`` both have post-open error sites
that must not rely on that frame alone. This module covers the cellat side.

## Why the symptom is worse here than in celldiag

celldiag replays a file and exits, so a lost reason still ends the run. cellat
surveys forever: all four sites are inside the poll loop and ``goto done``,
where the source spins down and Kismet re-opens it 5 s later. Without a
delivered reason the operator gets an unbounded ladder of ``IPC connection
closed`` / ``SOURCEERROR ... (N failures)`` with the cause discarded on every
iteration.

## Why this unplugs a fake modem rather than using a bogus IMEI

Do not reproduce this by pointing cellat at an IMEI that matches nothing:
resolving an IMEI runs an AT scan across every serial port on the host, which
on a workstation with modems attached opens live modems and writes AT commands
to them. ``test_cellat_ipc`` documents that hazard.

The celldiag trigger does not carry over either: ``replay=<missing file>``
works there because DIAG is a byte stream and the open is answered before the
file is touched. AT is a dialogue, and every cheap failure ``FakeAtModem`` can
script (wrong IMEI, empty ``+CGMR``, ``silent=True``) is rejected inside
``open_callback``. Open-path errors ride the open report's return code, which
the server does deliver, so a test built on one would pass without the fix and
prove nothing.

``FakeAtModem.unplug()`` is the trigger that works: let the open succeed, then
close the pty master so the next serial read fails. That reaches
``capture_thread``'s error sites with no hardware, and it models the real
failure: a modem that enumerates, identifies, then drops off the bus
mid-survey.
