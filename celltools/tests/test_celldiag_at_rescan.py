"""celldiag's IMEI scan rescans once when a sibling held its target's port.

## The race

In a concurrent multi-source open every source's IMEI scan walks the same ttys
at the same time. A port a sibling is probing is **skipped**: its exclusive claim
is taken, and sharing it would split the reply bytes. A scan can therefore find
all of its own target's AT ports held that way, come back empty, and proceed on
the explicit ``diagport=`` "without AT identity", so the model reads ``unknown``
in the rawlog name and ``prov.model``.

cellat handles the same race the same way, and celldiag mirrors it: keep flock's
``EWOULDBLOCK`` across the close of the refused fd, count the busy ports, and
rescan **once** after a short pid-jittered pause when -- and only when -- the
pass skipped one. These tests pin that.

## How the scan is reached offline

The scan globs ``/dev/ttyUSB*`` + ``/dev/ttyACM*``, which no PTY can join.
``CELLDIAG_SCAN_PORTS`` **replaces** that universe with the named paths.
Replacing, not adding, is what keeps these tests hermetic: an additive hook would
let a scan that skipped the busy PTY walk on into the host's real modems and
write ``AT`` to every one of them.

The "sibling mid-probe" is modelled exactly: the test opens the fake's slave path
itself and takes ``flock(LOCK_EX)`` on it -- the same claim ``diag_port_claim()``
takes -- so the helper's ``serial_open()`` is refused with ``EWOULDBLOCK``.

The bring-up runs deferred here (the production default), not with
``defer=false``. Inline, the bring-up runs inside ``open_callback`` on the
helper's IPC loop thread, so none of its messages reaches the pipe until the open
returns: the "rescanning" notice and the rescan's verdict arrive in the same
batch, and a test that frees the port at the notice frees it too late.
Deferred, the bring-up runs on the capture thread and its messages flow live.

## What each test pins

* ``test_the_scan_reaches_a_pty_named_by_CELLDIAG_SCAN_PORTS`` -- the positive
  control. Without it, every negative below could be "the scan never saw the PTY".
* ``test_a_port_busy_in_the_first_pass_is_found_by_the_one_rescan`` -- the rescan.
* ``test_a_port_busy_through_the_rescan_costs_exactly_one_rescan`` -- the bound,
  the busy COUNT, and that a held port is never written to.
* ``test_a_silent_port_is_not_busy_and_earns_no_rescan`` -- the gate: "not a
  modem" must not cost a rescan.
