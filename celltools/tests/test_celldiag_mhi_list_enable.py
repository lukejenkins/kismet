"""A PCIe/MHI modem is offered by ``--list`` and opens from a bare definition.

## The problem

A PCIe RM520N-GL has AT on ``/dev/mhi_DUN`` and DIAG on ``/dev/mhi_DIAG``. A
lister that walks only the USB ttys offers its AT source but never its DIAG
source. The non-USB AT nodes stay out of the USB pass on purpose (a USB source
must not AT-probe ``mhi_DUN`` first), so without a separate pass a bare
``celldiag-<imei>`` -- which is what the panel's Enable click sends -- fails
"not found on any serial port", and enabling DIAG means hand-writing
``atport=``/``diagport=``.

## The behavior

* ``--list`` runs a non-USB pass AFTER the USB one. A row is offered only when
  the DIAG node resolves unambiguously by name, and a held AT node is asked
  about through its holder's vouch.
* A bare definition falls back to the non-USB AT nodes only after the USB scan
  misses, and ``find_diag_port()`` resolves a non-USB AT sibling's DIAG node by
  name.

## How an MHI modem is built offline

As in ``test_celldiag_mhi_identity``: symlinks named ``mhi_DUN`` and
``mhi_DIAG`` point at PTY fakes, and ``CELLDIAG_SCAN_PORTS`` names the universe.
A named universe is the whole universe for the DIAG-by-name pick too, so these
tests never select the host's real ``/dev/mhi_*``, which may be a real modem.
