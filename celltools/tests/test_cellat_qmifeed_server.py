"""qmifeed= through a REAL Kismet server: QMI and AT merge into ONE tower.

``test_cellat_qmifeed.py`` proves the capture child relays the feed's lines;
it plays the server itself, so it cannot see what ``phy_cell`` does with them.
This file runs an isolated ``kismet`` (``KismetServer``) with a cellat source on
a fake modem whose ``+QENG`` serving cell is 311/480 TAC 0xD00 CI 0x334220, and
a feed that reports that same tower over QMI. What it pins:

* the tower is ONE device, and its ``seen_via`` carries both ``at`` and
  ``qmi`` -- the merge is keyed on identity, not on which pipe saw it;
* QMI's own contributed fields are recorded under ``qmi``.

The merge needs the two pipes to agree on mcc/mnc byte for byte. A QMI parser
that reads qmicli's nibble-swapped BCD PLMN '311048' as 311/048 instead of
311/480 makes the server split this tower in two. The case below feeds the
CORRECT decode; the split case is pinned so a regression there is
seen here as two devices, not as a quiet loss of the QMI half.
