"""The graceful datasource close, helper side, on the real binaries.

The server's plain way to stop a capture helper,
``kis_external_ipc::close_impl()``, closes the IPC pipe and SIGTERMs the helper
in the same call. The capture framework runs the capture thread
``PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS`` and leaves SIGTERM at its default disposition,
so a stop like that runs **no teardown at all**:

* cellat's END ``AT+CCLK?`` anchor is never even issued;
* celldiag's END ``DIAG_TS_F`` anchor reaches only the rawlog sidecar, and
  only on a pipe-EOF stop the server never makes;
* celldiag's END raw slice never goes out, so the stream reads
  "no END: end unconfirmed";
* celldiag's QSH-trace disarm-at-stop never runs.

The graceful close is a handshake. The helper opts in by advertising a close grace in its
OPENREPORT (field 11). The server then stops a source by sending ``CLOSEREQ``
(command 20) instead of closing the pipe. The helper leaves its capture loop,
runs its teardown **with the pipe still open**, drains its out-ring and exits on
its own. The server treats that EOF as a clean close, not an error.

These tests drive each helper exactly as that server does: send one CLOSEREQ and
**never close the pipe**, then read what arrives before the helper exits. The
harness's own fallback (pipe close, then SIGTERM after ``graceful_close_s``) is
left at 0, so a helper that ignored the request would be SIGTERMed at timeout
and fail the exit-code assertion.
