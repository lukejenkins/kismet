"""A scan probe's open() is bounded: a tty still closing does not cost ~30 s.

## The hazard

A scan probe writes ``AT\\r\\n`` into every candidate tty. On a function that
never reads its input -- the non-target Foxconn T99W175's NMEA tty -- the bytes
stay unsent, and the last ``close()`` waits out the port's 30 s ``closing_wait``.
That close runs on a detached thread, so the prober itself does not wait. But
the tty stays in its final close for those 30 s, and Linux's ``tty_open()``
retries a tty in that state instead of failing it, ``O_NONBLOCK`` or not. So the
next ``open()`` of the port blocks: a sibling source's scan, or the same
helper's own rescan. Unbounded, that costs a cellat source Kismet's whole 30 s
command deadline.

The bound: both scanners' ``serial_open()`` open through ``diag_probe_open()``,
which runs the ``open()`` on a worker thread and gives up at
``DIAG_PROBE_OPEN_DEADLINE_MS`` (1000 ms) with ``ETIMEDOUT``.

## How a stuck open is built offline

No fd a test can make reproduces a tty in its final close (a pty never waits in
close). What CAN be reproduced is its only effect on the scanner: an ``open()`` of
one path that does not return. ``stuck_open.so``, compiled here and injected with
``LD_PRELOAD``, sleeps ``STUCK_OPEN_MS`` inside ``open()`` of ``STUCK_OPEN_PATH``
and then performs the real open. Everything else in the binary is real.

The stuck path is a SILENT ``FakeAtModem`` (openable, never answers AT), so that
a regressed binary, which waits out the sleep and then really opens it, still
finds no modem there -- and the test can only pass on timing and on the message.

## What each test pins

* ``test_the_shim_blocks_open_of_exactly_the_named_path`` -- the positive control:
  the gauge reads positive on a known input, and leaves every other path alone.
* ``test_celldiag_scan_skips_a_port_whose_open_does_not_return`` -- the bound, in
  celldiag's real IMEI scan: the target behind the stuck port resolves in well
  under the stall, the port is named ``open-timeout``, and no rescan is spent.
* ``test_a_timed_out_open_is_not_busy_and_earns_no_rescan`` -- the gate: with no
  target to find, the skipped port must not earn a busy-port rescan.
* ``test_cellat_serial_open_gives_up_at_its_deadline`` -- the same bound in
  cellat's copy of ``serial_open()`` (``at_serial.inc``), through
  ``cellat_serial_probe``. cellat's scan cannot be driven offline without also
  AT-probing this host's real modems (``CELLAT_EXTRA_PORTS`` ADDS to the scan),
  so this is the cellat-side proof.
