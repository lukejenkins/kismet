"""Make ``celltools/`` and this directory importable for the harnesses here.

The modules under ``celltools/`` (``celldiag_parity``, ``decode_oracle``,
``check_binary_staleness``) are plain scripts, not an installed package: this
directory must run from a fresh checkout with nothing but pytest, so there is no
``pip install -e .`` step to lean on and no package name to import through.

pytest already prepends a test file's own directory under ``rootdir``-relative
collection, but that is an implementation detail of one invocation style. Doing
it here means ``pytest celltools/tests``, ``pytest <one file>``, and
``make -C celltools check`` all resolve imports identically -- a harness that
only imports under one of those is a harness that quietly does not run under the
others.
