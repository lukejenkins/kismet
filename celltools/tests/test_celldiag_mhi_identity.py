"""An MHI/wwan celldiag source reads its model from the non-USB AT node.

## The problem

A celldiag source whose ``diagport=`` is an MHI or wwan node (the PCIe
RM520N-GL's ``/dev/mhi_DIAG``) has no ttyUSB to scan, and in a fused
cellat+celldiag capture its one AT node, ``/dev/mhi_DUN``, is held by the paired
cellat source. Skipping AT identity there leaves the model ``unknown`` -- in the
rawlog name, in ``prov.model``, in the opened line.

## The behavior

That branch scans the non-USB AT nodes only (``/dev/mhi_DUN``,
``/dev/wwan*at*``, filtered by the shared classifier), so it neither AT-probes
every USB modem's ports nor misses its own. A node the paired cellat holds is
refused ``EWOULDBLOCK`` and never shared: one rescan, then the
"without AT identity" fallback. The other half of that contention -- cellat's
own open meeting this probe's claim -- is handled by cellat's claim wait.

## How an MHI modem is built offline

The branch keys on the diagport's NAME (``diag_wwan_classify`` reads the
basename), so symlinks named ``mhi_DIAG`` and ``mhi_DUN`` pointing at PTY fakes
engage the real MHI path in the real binary. ``CELLDIAG_SCAN_PORTS`` names the
universe, and a decoy fake behind a ``ttyUSB``-named link is in it too: the
non-USB scope must not probe it.
