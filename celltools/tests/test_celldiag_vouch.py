"""A held AT port's holder vouches for the modem, so its DIAG pair opens.

## The problem

A typical setup runs a ``cellat-<imei>`` and a ``celldiag-<imei>`` source on
every modem. celldiag maps IMEI -> DIAG port by AT-probing the modem's ports,
and the paired cellat holds its AT port (an exclusive flock) for the whole run.
The claim carries no payload, so a scan that meets it learns only that the port
is busy. Without a vouch, a single-AT-port modem such as the Foxconn T99W175
never opens its DIAG source, and a two-port modem such as the RM500Q-AE opens
only when its second AT port happens not to be mid-probe.

## The mechanism

cellat publishes what it read on the port it holds (``diag_identvouch``); a
celldiag scan that meets a busy port accepts that record once it has validated
it -- same device node instance, writer alive -- and the identity it reports
says ``method: "vouched"``, never ``"at"``.

## How it is reached offline

As in ``test_celldiag_at_rescan``: ``CELLDIAG_SCAN_PORTS`` replaces the
scan's ``/dev/ttyUSB*`` universe with the fakes' PTYs, and an explicit
``diagport=`` names the fake DIAG node (a PTY has no USB sibling to resolve).
The holder is the **real** ``kismet_cap_cell_at`` against the same fake, so the
record under test is the one the shipping writer produces, and the vouch
directory is a per-test ``KISMET_CELL_VOUCH_DIR``.

## What each test pins

* ``..._the_paired_cellat_holds_the_port_and_celldiag_still_identifies`` -- the
  fix: identity recovered, marked ``vouched``, no rescan spent.
* ``..._without_a_vouch_the_same_hold_opens_without_identity`` -- the control:
  the same busy port held by a non-vouching process still yields
  ``definition``. Without it the first test could pass for another reason.
* ``..._cellat_withdraws_its_vouch_on_a_graceful_close`` -- lifecycle.
* ``..._a_dead_holders_vouch_is_refused`` -- a record left by a holder that was
  killed (Kismet's SIGTERM runs no teardown) must not vouch for anything.
* ``..._a_vouch_for_another_modem_costs_no_rescan`` -- a vouched mismatch settles
  the port like an AT mismatch would.
