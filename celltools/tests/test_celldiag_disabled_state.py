"""A disabled celldiag source says "disabled", not "helper DEAD".

``enabled=false`` leaves a celldiag source defined, open and idle: no port, no
handshake, no decode helper. Kismet shows it as **running**, because its open
succeeded. Without a ``diag_stats`` JSON line (the server's fields are set from
it, not from the human ``stats:`` text line), ``helper_alive`` would sit at its
default 0 and the panel would render an intentionally idle source as a red
*"Decode helper DEAD -- observations have stopped"*.

So the idle loop sends ``{"helper_alive":0,"mask_preset":"disabled"}``
at once (not a 30 s ``stats_interval`` later) and on the cadence after, and
the panel renders a neutral "capture disabled". Both facts are true
measurements; no counter is sent, because nothing was measured and zeros would
read as "running and seeing nothing".
