"""celldiag emits the raw DIAG stream as DLT 147 packets, end to end.

The raw stream goes to the server as ``cf_send_data`` packets -- the path the
kismetdb logs into its ``packets`` table -- as offset-stamped slices whose
contract lives in ``capture_cell_diag/diag_rawpkt.h``. These tests drive the
REAL binary over the datasource IPC (replay, and a live pty modem) and read the
packets it actually sent.

**The byte-identity assertion is the load-bearing one.** Slices sorted by
their header ``offset`` and concatenated must BE the stream -- the replay file,
and the ``rawlog=`` tee of the same run -- so a kismetdb's packets can be turned
back into an equivalent ``.hdlc`` capture. Counting packets proves only that
something was sent.

**The full-ring test needs its positive control.** A replay must be lossless:
a full output ring waits instead of dropping. The test slows the harness to fill
the ring on purpose, and asserts the binary REPORTS having waited before it
trusts "nothing was dropped" -- a ring that never filled would pass the
no-drop assertion vacuously.
