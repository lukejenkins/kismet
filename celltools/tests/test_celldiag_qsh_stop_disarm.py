"""What a qsh=on celldiag capture leaves on the modem after a stop.

``qsh=on`` arms three things at bring-up: the QSH-trace ``0x9001`` maskset
(``0x9D``/``0x92``), the ``0x60`` event-report stream, and a diag_id binding
request. The stop teardown must disarm both the QSH-trace maskset and the
``0x60`` event stream; ``diag_config_disarm_latched`` alone sends only the
QSH-trace and F3 disarms, and an event stream left on is inherited by every
later tool on the modem.

These tests read the frames the capture wrote to the modem, on the real
binary against a PTY DIAG responder; no host port is touched.
