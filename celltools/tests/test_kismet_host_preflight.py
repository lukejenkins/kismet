"""Tests for celltools/kismet-host-preflight.sh.

The script asserts HOST state that lives nowhere in git — the nine
``/usr/local/etc/kismet*.conf`` symlinks, ``kismet_site.conf``'s four
``helper_binary_path`` entries, the celldiag decoder checkout, the data files,
and whether the ``kismet`` on PATH is older than the build tree.

Everything is driven through ``KISMET_ETC`` / ``KISMET_SHARE`` / ``KISMET_ROOT`` /
``KISMET_BIN`` into a ``tmp_path`` so the suite never reads or writes the real
``/usr/local`` and never depends on the developer's own environment.

Each test below is a **mutation of one healthy fixture**, and each asserts a
*different* line of output. A decline test is not a gate test: the assertions
name the **reason** the check failed, not the count of failures, so a mutation
that trips the wrong check does not pass silently.
