"""celldiag resolves (or explicitly names) the modem model, never a silent 'modem'.

## The hazard

The model that celldiag stamps into the raw-DIAG tee filename (rawlog ``%m``) and
into ``prov.model`` is the firmware string read by ``identify_modem`` (AT+CGMR).
On the EG25-G that read can come back empty while a ``cellat`` source holds a
sibling AT port and the ``at_scan`` is slow. The IMEI still matches (it is in the
source name), but with the firmware/model empty the tee filename would fall back
to the literal ``celldiag-modem-<imei>-<ts>.hdlc`` and the raw DIAG stream would
lose the model identity its siblings carry.

## The two guards, and what each test pins

* **Retry.** On an IMEI-targeted scan the IMEI already matched on the open port,
  so an empty AT+CGMR is a transient read under contention, not "no firmware".
  ``identify_modem`` retries AT+CGMR once.
  ``test_a_transient_empty_firmware_read_is_retried`` drives the real binary
  with an AT modem whose first AT+CGMR times out and whose second succeeds: the
  open succeeds and the model is resolved.

* **Explicit sentinel.** When celldiag proceeds without an AT identity at all
  (an MHI ``diagport=`` with no ``atport=`` — the intended fused-capture path),
  the model is stamped an explicit ``unknown`` and an INFO says so, instead of a
  blank that the rawlog turns into a modem literally named ``modem``.
  ``test_no_at_identity_stamps_an_explicit_unknown_not_a_silent_modem`` pins it.

## Scope

Verifies the open-time model decision against the real compiled binary via the
``fake_at_modem`` / ``fake_diag_modem`` PTY harness.
