"""Shared binary discovery for the celldiag parity harnesses.

## The gap this closes

The correctness of this tree's C decode path is *defined* by agreement with
diaggrok, a fetched dependency (``make -f standalone.mk deps``). Two harnesses pin
that agreement -- ``test_celldiag_logstream_parity.py`` (the HDLC→LOG
extractor) and ``test_celldiag_replay_ab.py`` (the compiled capture binary's
emitted observations) -- and both would skip silently unless
``KP_CELLDIAG_BIN`` / ``KP_CELLDIAG_LOGSTREAM_BIN`` were exported by hand.

That is the *"the build succeeded, so nothing complained"* shape one level up:
**the test suite passes while the thing under test never ran.** Nothing
requires anyone to set those variables, so without discovery the parity
harnesses run only when someone happens to remember to.

## What this module does, and what it deliberately does not

**Does:** find an already-built driver **in the tree this file ships in**, so
the common case ("you built it, then ran the tests") needs no environment at
all.

The root is derived from ``__file__``, not from a sibling-directory
convention, and that is deliberate: a conventional default can resolve to a tree
the operator is not building, which makes a green run mean *"some* tree is
built" rather than *"this one* is". ``KP_ROOT`` overrides -- the same override
``celltools/kismet-host-preflight.sh`` takes, so the two agree on what "this
tree" means.

**Does not:** build inside a test run by default. A ``make`` invoked from pytest
turns a 2-second suite into a multi-minute one and makes a compiler error look
like a test failure. Set ``CELLDIAG_PARITY_BUILD=1`` to opt in; the gauge
(``celltools/celldiag_parity_status.py``) builds explicitly instead, which is
where the cost belongs.

**Does not:** fail when a driver is absent. The skip is *correct* on a checkout
nobody has built. What matters is that "there is no source tree here" and
"nobody built the driver" are not the same silence: they are different
strings, and the gauge reports which.

## Resolution vocabulary

``discover()`` returns a ``Discovery`` whose ``status`` is one of:

===============  =============================================================
``env``          an explicit ``KP_*_BIN`` won; the operator's choice always wins
``discovered``   found built in this tree
``built``        not present, and ``CELLDIAG_PARITY_BUILD=1`` built it
``no-tree``      ``KP_ROOT`` points somewhere that is not a source tree -- only
                 reachable via an override, since the default is derived from
                 this file's own location. A legitimate, uninteresting skip
``not-built``    the tree is here and the driver was never built -- THE
                 interesting case, and the one most easily left invisible
``not-configured`` the tree was never ``./configure``d, so there
                 is no makefile to build with -- a fact about the HOST, in the
                 same family as ``no-tree`` / ``not-built``
``build-failed`` opted into the build and it failed -- never silent
``env-bad``      ``KP_*_BIN`` is set but is not an executable file
===============  =============================================================

## Why ``not-configured`` is its own status

This is an **autotools** project: a fresh clone carries ``Makefile.in`` but no
generated ``Makefile``. ``make`` in that state fails with *"No rule to make
target"*. Reported as ``build-failed`` -- which in this module's vocabulary
means **"a real breakage -- investigate"** -- it would send the reader hunting
for a compiler error that does not exist, i.e. tell the operator the *wrong
kind* of thing is wrong. An unconfigured clone is a property of the machine, exactly like
``no-tree``, and its remedy is one command.

**The gauge deliberately does NOT run ``./configure`` itself**, even under
``--build`` / ``CELLDIAG_PARITY_BUILD=1``. Configuring someone's clone writes
makefiles across the whole tree and bakes in host paths -- a categorically
heavier side effect than compiling one target that the operator already opted
into. It reports the remedy and stops.

**Not in ``_BENIGN``.** Unlike ``no-tree``, this IS fixable on this host, so
``--check`` must still flag it; it is a *different* skip reason, not an
excusable one.

#                  ``test_diag_*.c`` unit drivers, in no ``MONITOR_OBJS``.
#                  Editing one fails every replay test against a binary that
#                  is current.
#   under-broad -- ``diag_native_decode.cpp`` is in that directory but is
#                  ``.cpp``, which ``*.c`` never matches, and the C++ decode
#                  legs (``DIAGSPEC_SRCS``) live in ``../diagspec/`` outside it
#                  entirely. Both link into the binary via ``NATIVE_OBJS``.
#                  Editing a decode leg would leave the binary reading
#                  "current" -- the silence this guard exists to break, inside
#                  the guard itself.
#
# The ``.d`` files are necessary but not
# sufficient: the Makefile's rule is ``$(patsubst %c.o,%c.d,$(MONITOR_OBJS))``,
# so **no ``.d`` is generated for any C++ object**. The set below is therefore a
# union -- the link rule names the objects, ``.d`` files supply each C object's
# transitive headers, and objects without a ``.d`` fall back to resolving their
# source through the Makefile's own ``vpath``.
#
# Everything is derived from the real build inputs, which is the discipline the
# guard is itself enforcing: adding an object to ``MONITOR_OBJS`` or a leg to
# ``DIAGSPEC_SRCS`` is covered with no edit here.

#
# ``test_celldiag_replay_ab.py`` fails when the compiled driver predates its own
# sources, and that guard is correct. The problem is one of ORDERING:
# anything that restamps source mtimes without rebuilding -- a fast-forward, a
# ``git checkout``, a ``stash pop`` -- leaves a built driver older than the code
# it was built from, and nothing between that event and the eventual pytest run
# connects the two. The suite then opens red with a one-line summary naming a
# ``mask=wardrive`` decode test, which reads like a decode regression. That
# invites debugging the wrong thing, or learning to ignore red.
#
# The predicate is answered here rather than in the test so a sync-time warning
# and the test-time failure ask the *same question*. Warning on "the tree moved"
# would have been a different, sloppier question in both directions: the tree can
# advance without touching this binary's link closure (a false alarm the operator
# learns to ignore), and the binary can go stale with the tree untouched -- a
# local edit -- which that phrasing misses entirely.
