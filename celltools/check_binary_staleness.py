"""Warn when a built driver predates its own sources.

## Why this exists separately from the test guard

Anything that advances this tree without rebuilding -- a fetch and
fast-forward, a branch switch, a ``stash pop`` -- restamps the mtimes of the
sources ``kismet_cap_cell_diag`` links, so the already-built binary is now
stale, and ``tests/test_celldiag_replay_ab.py`` correctly FAILS on it.

Nothing connects the two events: a clean sync is followed by a red test whose
one-line summary looks like a decode regression rather than a build artifact.
The cost is one ``make``; the cost of not saying so is either debugging the
wrong thing or learning to ignore a red suite, and the second is strictly worse.

So this is meant to be run by whatever advances the tree, reporting the
condition at the moment it is *created*, where the remedy is one line away,
instead of leaving it to surface as an unrelated-looking failure minutes later.

## What it deliberately does not do

**It does not build.** Running ``make`` from a sync step would add a
compiler dependency to a read-only operation, and turn a two-second sweep into a
multi-minute one on a cold tree. It prints the exact command and stops -- the
same line ``celldiag_parity`` refuses to cross for ``./configure``.

**It does not fail its caller by default.** Exit status stays 0 for a stale
binary: a sync's nonzero status conventionally means *"this checkout needs
attention before you proceed"* (dirty / divergent / fetch-failed) and a stale
build artifact is not that. ``--check`` opts into a nonzero exit for a caller
that wants a gate.

Both of those are why the predicate lives in ``celldiag_parity.staleness()``
rather than here: the test guard and this warning must agree, and the way they
stop agreeing is by each computing "its sources" its own way.

Usage:
    python3 celltools/check_binary_staleness.py           # advisory
    python3 celltools/check_binary_staleness.py --check   # exit 1 if stale
