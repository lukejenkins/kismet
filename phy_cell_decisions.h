    The testable decision layer of phy_cell.

    phy_cell.cc is the single funnel every cell observation passes through on
    its way from a capture helper into Kismet's device tree -- both `cellat`
    and `celldiag`, every RAT, every DIAG log code. This header pulls the pure
    decisions out of it so they can be unit tested.

    The motivating failure mode is silence. A guard in json_to_cell such as

        auto rsrp_j = json["rsrp"];
        if (!rsrp_j.is_number() || rsrp_j.get<int>() == 0)
            return false;

    deletes the entire DIAG leg on any modem whose 0xB193 subpacket version
    has no grounded RSRP scale (v18/v22/v35/v36/v48-RSRQ, roughly half of
    observed traffic), while the datasource still reports running, no errors,
    a live helper and a growing observation count -- and produces zero devices.

    What this file is, and is not. json_to_cell is not a pure function: it
    calls update_common_device, entrytracker, fetch_or_add and takes the
    devicelist mutex. Testing it whole means linking most of the server. What
    is pure is every decision made before that boundary, and those decisions
    determine whether a device appears at all, what MAC it gets, and what it
    is called. So this header holds them, json_to_cell calls them, and
    test_phy_cell_decisions links only this plus fmt.

    The split is between mutation and decision. Both of these are decisions
    and live here:

      * seen_via accumulation  -> prov_field_keys / contributed_fields /
        merge_prov_fields / prov_origin_wins. The entrytracker only allocates
        the record; what goes in it is arithmetic on strings.
      * pci_to_full_identity promotion -> pci_promotion(). The device tree only
        resolves a key to a device; which keys to look up, and whether to look
        at all, is pure. Writing it down is what exposes the cross-RAT
        collision documented on pci_promotion() below.

    Deliberately not covered here, so nobody reads a passing suite as more
    coverage than it is:
      * update_common_device / signal tracking (needs the packet chain)
      * that add_related_device actually links both directions in the tracker --
        pci_promotion() decides the two keys; it cannot observe the insert.

 * Why not adler32: a derivation of bytes[0..3] = adler32(key), bytes[4..5] =
 * adler32(key + "_cell") & 0xFFFF does not work. Kismet's adler32 keeps `ls1`

 *   one PCI, EARFCN 1..8000                       86%
 *
 * Those are not adversarial inputs; `LTE_pci120_1850` and `LTE_pci201_1850` are
 * two ordinary neighbours on one carrier, and they collide. Full identity is no
 * safer: `310260_1_1000080` and `310260_2_1000007` differ in both TAC and CID
 * and collide. FNV-1a-64 is used instead -- self-contained, no dependency, and
 * it distributes all 48 bits.
 *
 * `cell_key` is stored on the device as-is, so a cell's identity does not
