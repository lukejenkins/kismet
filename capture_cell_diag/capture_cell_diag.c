    Cell modem DIAG capture source for Kismet (diaggrok bridge).

    Passively taps a Qualcomm modem's DIAG port, applies a narrow DIAG log
    mask (LTE ML1 serving 0xB193 and related codes), and pumps the raw HDLC
    byte stream to a Python bridge helper (kismet_diag_decode.py, shipped beside
    this binary). There is nothing to configure: the decoder is the one this
    binary's own tree fetched (`make -f standalone.mk deps`), else the one
    `make install` put in the data dir, and the interpreter is python3 on PATH
    with that decoder prepended to PYTHONPATH -- see decoder_root_resolve /
    resolve_python / resolve_helper_script. The helper decodes each DIAG LOG_F
    record with diaggrok and emits cell_observation JSON lines, which this binary relays to Kismet via
    cf_send_json() exactly as capture_cell_at does. Every observation carries a
    prov block {"src":"diag","origin":"0xB193",...} so phy_cell can merge DIAG
    signal with AT identity on one tower without duplicates.

    The raw byte stream itself also goes to Kismet: cf_send_data()
    packets with DLT 147, offset-stamped slices the server logs into the
    kismetdb `packets` table (rawpackets=, contract in diag_rawpkt.h). The
    server only logs them; decoding stays here, behind the helper pipe.

    The pipe boundary (raw HDLC bytes out, JSON lines in) is the seam where a
    pure-C decoder replaces the helper subprocess behind the same interface,
    one log code at a time.

    Addressing mirrors capture_cell_at: the source is celldiag-<15-digit IMEI>.
    The IMEI is resolved to a modem via an AT probe on a sibling serial port,
    then the DIAG interface (conventionally if00, the lowest USB interface on
    that modem's USB device) is opened for the tap.

    Source options:
      diagport=<path>    explicit DIAG /dev/tty node (overrides auto-detect)
      atport=<path>      explicit AT-identify node (overrides the ttyUSB
                         IMEI scan). Optional for an MHI/wwan modem: a bare
                         celldiag-<imei> that no USB port answers falls back
                         to the non-USB AT nodes (/dev/mhi_DUN, /dev/wwan*at*,
                         or their holder's vouch) and picks the DIAG node by
                         name -- which is what --list and the web UI's Enable
                         click offer. Name it (with diagport=) when several
                         PCIe modems make the by-name pick ambiguous.
      replay=<file>      decode a raw-HDLC capture file instead of a live modem
                         (offline test hook; no modem opened, no mask sent)
      rawlog=<path>      tee the raw HDLC DIAG byte stream to <path> while it is
                         also decoded (write-side mirror of replay=). The file
                         is a replay-compatible raw-HDLC capture, written
                         uncompressed (compress it afterwards if wanted).
                         Path tokens: %i=IMEI, %m=model, %t=UTC-timestamp; a
                         directory (or trailing '/') gets a synthesized
                         celldiag-<imei>-<ts>.hdlc filename. Never truncated:
                         if the file already holds an earlier session's
                         bytes, this session tees to a sibling
                         <stem>-<UTC ts><ext> (then -2, -3 ...) and says so.
      enabled=true|false per-source lifecycle switch. false leaves the
                         source defined-but-idle: registered and visible, but no
                         DIAG port opened, no mask/F3 handshake, no helper
                         spawned - nothing captured until re-enabled. Runtime
                         enable/disable/restart is driven by the Kismet server
                         reaping/respawning this process; a fresh enabled=true
                         open re-acquires the port and re-runs the handshake.
                         Default true.
      nomask=true        skip the LOG_CONFIG handshake (passive tap of whatever
                         a prior tool already enabled)
      mask=wardrive|full LOG_CONFIG subscription preset. wardrive
                         (default) subscribes the curated WiGLE-relevant set
                         (0xB193/0xB0C0/0xB192/0xB195/0xB17F/0xB197/0xB821/0xB97F) -- low
                         volume. full subscribes EVERY LOG code the modem
                         advertises across all equipment-id ranges -- HIGH
                         volume, for diagnosis not wardriving. Ignored under
                         nomask=true. If unset, the per-modem default from the
                         matched profile's diag.mask_default is used (see
                         profiles=), else wardrive.
      profiles=<dir>     dir of capture_cell_at profile JSONs providing per-modem
                         defaults for mask= (diag.mask_default), f3=
                         (diag.f3_default), and spc= (diag.spc), selected by the
                         modem firmware via each profile's firmware_match glob.
                         An explicit source option always overrides the
                         profile default.
                         Default: $CELLDIAG_PROFILES, else compiled-in (empty =>
                         defaults not consulted).
      spc=<6 digits>     DIAG_SPC_F unlock sent before LOG_CONFIG. Needed
                         on SPC-gated modems (EC2x/EG2x, e.g. EG25-G) whose
                         SET_MASK is refused until unlocked; factory default is
                         000000. Absent by default (no SPC sent) -- unchanged for
                         the ungated SDX24/SDX55 parts. If unset, the per-modem
                         default from the matched profile's diag.spc is used (see
                         profiles=); an explicit spc= overrides it.
      f3=off|all|        F3 debug-message arming, orthogonal to mask=
         high|error      (F3 rides DIAG_EXT_MSG_CONFIG_F, not LOG_CONFIG). off
                         (default) arms no F3. The other three run
                         SET_ALL_RT_MASKS with a different runtime-level mask:
                           all    every subsystem at every severity (0xFFFFFFFF)
                                  -- the modem's full 0x79 / QSR4 0x99 trace.
                                  HIGH volume.
                           high   0xFFFFFFFC -- as all, minus sites that only
                                  ever print at LOW/MED. ~94% of records kept.
                           error  0xFFFFFFF8 -- also drops HIGH-only sites.
                                  ~68% of records kept; the volume-trimming
                                  default if you want one.
                         The floors are SUBTRACTIVE: they silence sites whose
                         mask carries ONLY low ladder bits and keep every
                         per-SSID custom-bit site (ML1 / tuner / GNSS prints).
                         A *selective* "ERROR|FATAL" floor would keep 1.3% of a
                         real F3 stream and is deliberately not offered -- see
                         diag_config.h for the measurements.
                         Composes with any mask= preset (incl. nomask=true). If
                         unset, the per-modem default from the matched profile's
                         diag.f3_default is used (see profiles=), else off.
      qsh=on|off         FULL F3 surface -- the QSH-trace 0x9001 maskset
                         (0x9D/0x92) + 0x60 events + a diag_id binding request,
                         armed as a gated tier over the same DIAG fd (not a
                         second datasource). off (default) so a lean wardrive
                         never pays the QSH volume; on is a development drive
                         that captures every F3 type diaggulp's --qsh-*
                         defaults arm. Composes with f3= and mask=. QSH emits no
                         cell observations; its value is in the rawlog= tee.
                         Disarmed on stop, REST close or Ctrl-C: the QSH-trace
                         latch (it survives reboots, so it must be cleared),
                         F3, and the 0x60 event stream the arm turned on.
      stats_interval=<s> seconds between "is data flowing?" health status lines
                         on the message bus (default 30; 0 disables). The line
                         reports a health verdict, bytes read, observation count
                         + rolling obs/sec, last-observation age, helper
                         liveness, and the active mask - so a stalled modem is
                         distinguishable from a healthy one within one interval.
      clock_anchor_sec=<s> cadence of the host<->modem-ts64 clock anchor: a
                         DIAG_TS_F request at START,
                         every <s> seconds (default 30; 0 = periodic off) and at
                         END, each reply paired with the host clock as a
                         type="ClockAnchor" kismetdb row and a line of
                         <rawlog>.clock_anchor.jsonl -- so a GNSS-off drive can
                         still put absolute UTC on every frame. Live modems only.
      rawpackets=on|off  send the raw DIAG stream to Kismet as packets:
                         DLT 147 (LINKTYPE_USER0) offset-stamped slices the
                         server logs into the kismetdb `packets` table, so the
                         .kismet carries the stream itself, not only what was
                         decoded from it. Default on; independent of rawlog=
                         (the file tee). Contract: diag_rawpkt.h. A live source
                         DROPS a slice when Kismet's ring is full rather than
                         stall the port, and records the first drop as a
                         type="RawDiagDrop" row; a replay waits and stays
                         lossless. A stream that reaches its teardown closes
                         with an END slice.
      debug=true|false   verbose message-bus logging

    Runtime-settable options. Kismet's one generic runtime setter for a
    datasource is `POST /datasource/by-uuid/<uuid>/set_channel`, so every knob
    multiplexes through that single string, in the same key=value spelling:

      rawlog=<path>      start or REDIRECT the tee while capturing. The new sink
                         is opened before the old one is closed, so a bad path
                         costs you nothing.
      rawlog=off|none    stop the tee. rawlog_path is deliberately RETAINED so a
                         stopped tee stays distinguishable from one that was
                         never configured.

    Everything else is open-time only and says so by name when set at runtime --
    `mask=` and `f3=` because applying either means re-issuing a handshake on
    the DIAG fd the capture thread is blocked reading. Use Kismet's
    close_source / open_source with a new definition instead.

    NOTE: a refused runtime option is reported in the message, not the status
    code. The framework maps only a negative chancontrol return to failure on
    the wire, and a negative return also tears the source down -- so reporting
    a typo as a failure would end a running wardrive. See celldiag_chancontrol().

/* Locate the DIAG interface on the same USB device as `sibling_port`.

 * (if00), so we pick the tty on that USB device with the smallest interface
 * number. That if00-is-DIAG assumption does not hold for every modem, so an
 * optional per-model descriptor `pd` (resolved from the profile's
 * diag.port_detect) refines it:
 *   - pd->transport: "ttyUSB" (default) is handled here. "wwan_mhi" (and its
 *     "wwan"/"mhi" spellings) is auto-detected -- find_diag_port
 *     dispatches it to find_diag_port_wwan(), which classifies by node name
 *     because a PCIe modem has no USB descriptor to classify. "qmi_embedded" is
 *     not auto-detected -> actionable message, return 0.
 *   - pd->match == "interface" with pd->has_interface: select the ttyUSB whose
 *     USB bInterfaceNumber == pd->interface exactly (the robust path). Otherwise
 *     (match "lowest", or no descriptor) use the lowest-interface pick.
 * `pd` may be NULL, which is the default (ttyUSB/lowest).
 *
 * Returns 1 on success (out filled), 0 if the USB device or a matching tty
 * cannot be found. On failure, if `diag`/`diagsz` are provided, an actionable
 * diagnostic is composed there: which USB device the IMEI matched, which ttyUSB
 * interfaces were enumerated on it, and what to do about it. */

 * such anchor in the node names, so this enumerates the whole node space and

 * file, the deframer would walk compressed bytes: high-entropy data contains

 * and the occasional one passes CRC16. The source would then report health
 * as "RX-NO-OBS | bytes=N | obs=0" -- the file read fine, and the radio
 * looks quiet ("no cells in range"), which is the misleading part.
 *
 * We refuse rather than decompress on purpose. Decompressing in C means linking
 * libzstd into the capture binary, which is a build-system decision; the
 * offline harness decompresses its fixtures before replaying them.
 *
 * A magic-byte reject, not a positive is-this-a-capture proof: the

 *
 * One visible side effect worth stating: on success the framework stores the
 * knob string as the source's `channel` (capture_framework.c, `caph->channel =

 * `rawlog=/path.hdlc`. That is informative rather than wrong -- it is the last
