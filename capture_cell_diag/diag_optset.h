/* diag_optset.h - runtime source-option parsing for the celldiag source.
 *
 * Kismet has exactly ONE generic runtime setter for a datasource:
 * `POST /datasource/by-uuid/:uuid/set_channel`, which arrives here as the
 * CONFIGURE frame's channel string. So every runtime knob celldiag wants has to
 * multiplex through one opaque string, in the same `key=value` spelling the
 * source definition uses at open time:
 *
 *     rawlog=/captures/run.hdlc     start (or redirect) the raw DIAG tee
 *     rawlog=off                    stop the tee
 *
 * The classification is the point, not the parse. Three outcomes must stay
 * distinguishable, because an operator's next action differs for each:
 *
 *   - UNKNOWN key      -> you typed something this source has never heard of
 *   - OPEN_TIME_ONLY   -> a real celldiag option, just not settable while
 *                         running; close and reopen the source to change it
 *   - BAD_VALUE        -> right key, wrong value
 *
 * Collapsing OPEN_TIME_ONLY into UNKNOWN would send an operator hunting for a
 * typo in a correctly-spelled option, and collapsing it into OK would be worse:
 * a knob that reports success and changes nothing (for example, an `f3=all`
 * that is accepted on a replay source and silently does nothing).
 *
 * This module deliberately knows NOTHING about the f3/mask preset tables.
 * `F3_PRESETS` and the `mask=` table live in capture_cell_diag.c and are the
 * single source of truth for which *values* are legal; duplicating them here
 * would create two lists that drift apart. What this
 * module owns is the KEY vocabulary and the syntax. The caller validates the
 * value with the same table the open-time parse uses -- see
 * `diag_optset_set_value_error()` for how a caller reports that back.
 *
 * Pure libc, no Kismet dependency, so it is unit-tested standalone in
 * test_diag_optset.c (`make check` in this directory).
