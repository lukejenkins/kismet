# baseline_platform.mk -- the no-autoconf config BOTH capture drivers' `baseline`
# targets share. Included by capture_cell_diag/standalone.mk and
# capture_cell_at/standalone.mk; the includer sets BASELINE_DIR first.
#
# ONE fragment, not two copies: the two drivers link the same capture framework,
# so a config.h rule that learned a platform in one makefile and not the other
# would build one driver and leave its sibling broken.
#
# WHAT IT DECIDES, AND FROM WHAT
# --------------------
#   target OS   `uname -s`, overridable as BASELINE_TARGET_OS=<Linux|Darwin> for a
#               cross-compile (uname measures the BUILD host, not the target).
#               Linux -> SYS_LINUX, Darwin -> SYS_DARWIN -- the same mapping the
#               top-level configure.ac makes. Anything else is refused up front:
#               it has never been tested.
#   websockets  LWS=auto (default) probes `pkg-config 'libwebsockets >= 3.1.0'`,
#               the same floor ./configure enforces; LWS=1 / LWS=0 force it.
#
# libwebsockets is a CONFIG CHOICE here, not a structural dependency: every lws
# include, every `struct lws_*` member and every lws call site in
# capture_framework.{c,h} sits under `#ifdef HAVE_LIBWEBSOCKETS`, with `#else`
# stubs. With lws undefined, both drivers link on macOS against libSystem alone.
#
# What a no-lws build loses: the remote-capture websocket transport
# (`--connect ws://...`). Local IPC capture -- the path Kismet uses to run a
# helper on the same host, and the only path the parity harnesses use -- is
# unaffected. The generated config.h and the build output both say so.

# The target OS. `?=` so a cross-compile states it rather than inheriting the
# build host's (`uname` measures the wrong machine in exactly that case).
