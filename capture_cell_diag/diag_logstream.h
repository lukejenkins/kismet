    Streaming raw-HDLC -> DIAG LOG record extractor.

    WHY THIS EXISTS. diag_native_decode.{h,cpp} makes the diagspec
    cell_observation legs callable from THIS process (the helper), but a leg
    takes a log-code-stripped LOG_F payload, which the helper's capture path
    does not produce. The helper reads a raw HDLC byte stream off the DIAG port
    and pipes it verbatim to the Python bridge, which owns the framing:

        diaggrok.hdlc.iter_log_records_stream()  ->  (log_code, ts64, payload)

    diag_capture.c returns whole HDLC frames of any opcode and does not unwrap
    the QShrink4 / QSR envelopes (0x98 / 0x99 / 0x92) that SDX55/62/72
    basebands pack LOG_F records into.

    This module does that unwrapping in C. It is a direct translation of diaggrok's
    ``iter_log_records_stream`` / ``_process_frame`` / ``_extract_log_f``, kept
    deliberately structure-for-structure with the Python so the two can be
    diffed by eye when either changes.

    THE STREAMING CONTRACT (and why splitting on a raw 0x7E is safe). HDLC
    byte-stuffs any 0x7E occurring inside a frame as 0x7D 0x5E, so a literal 0x7E
    in the stream is ALWAYS a frame delimiter, never frame content. We accumulate
    a `residual` of the bytes after the last delimiter seen; a frame spanning two
    reads simply stays there until its delimiter arrives. The residual is bounded
    by one in-flight frame, so memory does not grow with stream length.

    The equivalence property the selftest pins -- the same one diaggrok's
    test_hdlc.py pins for the Python -- is that the emitted record sequence is
    INDEPENDENT OF CHUNKING:

        feed(a); feed(b); flush()   ==   feed(a || b); flush()

    for any split. A live read() boundary lands wherever the kernel says, so a
    chunking-sensitive extractor would decode differently on every run.

    NOT a decoder: this produces (log_code, ts64, payload) and nothing more. What
    the payload MEANS is diag_native_decode()'s business.
