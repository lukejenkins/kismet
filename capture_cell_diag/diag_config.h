/* diag_config.h - DIAG LOG_CONFIG narrow-mask handshake.
 *
 * To make a modem emit specific DIAG log codes we run the DIAG_LOG_CONFIG_F
 * (0x73) handshake: RETRIEVE_RANGES to learn how many codes each of the 16 log
 * types advertises, then one SET_MASK per touched type with a bitmask that
 * subscribes to EXACTLY the codes we want (not qcsuper's "all logs", which
 * floods the stream). A DIAG log code is (equipment_id << 12) | item: the top
 * 4 bits pick the log type (index into bitsizes), the low 12 bits are the item
 * within it. Within a type's mask, item i is bit (i % 8) of byte (i / 8),
 * LSB-first.
 *
 * The mask math is kept identical to diaggulp.py's _narrow_mask_bytes so the
 * Python diaggrok bridge and this binary drive the modem the same way.

 * `ss_mask` (the per-site mask the firmware compiles in, and the same value the
 * qdb hash rows carry in their `ss_mask` column). A site emits iff the AND is
 * nonzero. The low 5 bits are a severity ladder; bits >= 5 are per-SSID custom
 * meanings, not higher severities. Across qdbs from several vendors and chipset
 * families, the share of sites whose format string contains an error word rises
 * monotonically with the ladder bit.
 *
 * The masks below are subtractive on purpose. A *selective* floor ("send
 * ERROR|FATAL", i.e. 0x00000018) looks like the obvious reading of "severity
 * floor" but acts as a mute button: about two thirds of F3 records come from
 * sites carrying only custom bits, so 0x00000018 keeps roughly 1% of the stream
 * and drops the ML1 / tuner / GNSS prints that F3 is wanted for. Clearing low
 * ladder bits from all-ones silences ladder-only sites and leaves every
 * custom-bit site armed.
 *
 * Typical retention (SIM8202G-M2 drive capture):
 *   ALL          0xFFFFFFFF  100.0%
 *   HIGH_AND_UP  0xFFFFFFFC   94.2%   drop LOW+MED-only sites
 *   ERROR_AND_UP 0xFFFFFFF8   68.4%   drop LOW+MED+HIGH-only sites

 * latched. (An operator who wants F3 re-arms it with the f3= preset, which runs
