 * and a DIAG port is one of the ports it probes, so celldiag and cellat race
 * by construction whenever both run on the same modem.
 *
 * flock() is advisory: it only excludes other flock() users, which is why both
 * binaries take it (cellat's is in capture_cell_at/at_serial.inc). The
 * lock is per open-file-description and the kernel drops it when the last fd
 * referring to that description closes, INCLUDING on crash, so no stale lock
 * can strand a port.

 * port. Does not close fd -- the caller owns it either way. */
