"""Generate the canned raw-HDLC replay fixture the `functional` target replays.

    python3 fixtures/make_functional_fixture.py --out fixtures/functional.hdlc

Why this file exists
--------------------
Anyone should be able to run the tree's own proof and see it decode something
without access to a private capture collection. A fixture-backed test that
skips for lack of a capture proves nothing, so the tree carries its own.

This generator is committed beside the bytes it produces so the fixture is
auditable rather than opaque: a reader can see exactly which fields are set to
which values and regenerate the file, rather than trust 2 KB of binary.

The fixture is synthesised, not scrubbed
----------------------------------------
The bytes below were never emitted by a modem. Every identity in them is an
invented constant chosen for being *obviously* invented, so the fixture is
free of personal data by construction rather than by inspection. A scrubbed
real capture is only as clean as the scrubber's coverage; here there is
nothing to miss.

Concretely:
  * IMEI is stamped by the bridge at replay time, not by this file, and the
    `functional` target passes the all-zero synthetic IMEI 000000000000000.
  * PCI / EARFCN are round decimal placeholders (111, 222, 333, 444; EARFCN
    2600 and 900), not values copied off a real cell.
  * No GNSS record is present at all, so the fixture carries no coordinate.

What it emits
-------------
Four DIAG `0xB193` records (LTE ML1 Serving Cell Meas Response), subpacket
version 36 -- the SDX20 layout (Telit LM960 / Quectel EG18-NA):

  * it is a common layout in real captures, not an exotic corner;
  * its per-cell geometry is well grounded (F3 log pairing, concurrent AT
    readings, and a 3GPP TS 36.214 closure onto exact RB counts) -- see the
    parser's v36 constants block. A fixture built on an ungrounded layout
    would assert numbers nobody trusts;
  * single-cell records carry a decodable RSRP *and* RSRQ, so the expected
    output pins real decoded values rather than only an identity.

Four records, not one, and the count is structural rather than cosmetic.
`diaggrok.dlf.detect_format` classifies a stream as `"hdlc"` only when its head
window holds at least `_HDLC_MIN_DELIMS == 4` `0x7E` delimiters, and
`is_probably_capture` -- which the bridge runs before decoding anything --
returns False for any other verdict. A three-frame fixture is therefore
invisible to the detector even though every frame in it is CRC-valid: the
bridge refuses it with "not a DIAG capture" while `_has_crc_valid_frame` on
the same bytes returns True. The leading idle flag byte (real DIAG streams
open with one) plus four frames clears the floor with margin. Do not trim this
fixture to "one record is enough to prove decode".

Framing
-------
Each record is a DIAG_LOG_F (opcode 0x10) frame, HDLC-escaped, CRC-16 tailed and
0x7E-terminated -- the same wire the C helper's `replay=` deframes:

    [0]      u8   0x10        cmd
    [1]      u8   0x00        pending
    [2:4]    u16  outer_len   == len(frame) - 4
    [4:6]    u16  inner_len   == outer_len (the redundant duplicate)
    [6:8]    u16  log_code
    [8:16]   u64  ts64
    [16:]         payload

Both length fields matter. `diaggrok.hdlc._is_len_desync` rejects a frame
whose `outer_len` disagrees with its true length, and a fixture that gets this
wrong decodes to zero records while every byte still looks plausible -- the
silent-empty outcome the `functional` target exists to rule out.

The CRC is the reflected CRC-16-CCITT Qualcomm DIAG uses (poly 0x8408, register
seeded 0xFFFF, LSB-first, output XOR 0xFFFF). It is implemented inline here
rather than imported from diaggrok, so this generator runs on a bare python3
with no dependency at all -- including on a tree that has not run `make deps`.
