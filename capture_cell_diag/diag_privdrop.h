/* diag_privdrop.h - drop a setuid/setgid install's elevated ids in a forked
 * child, before it execs a command the caller chose.
 *
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later
 *
 * `make suidinstall` installs kismet_cap_cell_at and kismet_cap_cell_diag
 * setuid root, mode 4550, like every other Kismet capture. Unlike the others,
 * both start a child whose command the SOURCE DEFINITION or the ENVIRONMENT
 * names: cellat's `qmifeed=<command>` (run by /bin/sh) and `qmifeed=auto`
 * (python3 off $PATH), and celldiag's bridge interpreter (python3 off $PATH).
 * Without a drop, a member
 * of the suid group gets a shell at the binary's effective uid.
 *
 * None of those children needs the elevated ids. The capture binary opens the
 * modem itself and hands the child a pipe; the child only decodes. So the
 * child gives them up -- real ids become all three of real/effective/saved --
 * and a caller-chosen command runs as the caller, exactly as it would have
 * without the suid bit.
 *
 * One consequence, stated because it is the intended one: under a suid
 * install, `qmifeed=`'s qmicli runs as the invoking user, so it needs its own
 * access to /dev/cdc-wdm* (a udev rule, or run Kismet's capture as root). A
 * suid bit is not a way to lend qmicli root.
 *
 * Not suid (ruid == euid, rgid == egid): a no-op, returns 0.
 *
 * FAILS CLOSED: if an id cannot be dropped, or can be regained afterwards,
 * this returns -1 and writes why into err. Callers _exit() rather than exec.
 * Header-only (static inline), so both captures and their selftests share one
 * implementation with no new object in either build. */
