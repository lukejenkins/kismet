    Selftest for the phy_cell decision layer.

    phy_cell.cc is the single funnel every cell observation passes through on
    its way into Kismet's device tree -- both cellat and celldiag, every RAT,
    every DIAG log code. Its failures tend to be silent: a one-line RSRP guard
    can delete the entire DIAG leg for half of 0xB193 traffic while every
    datasource counter looks healthy.

    Scope, stated so a green run is not overread. This covers every decision
    made before the tracker boundary: key derivation, identity level, the RSRP
    keep-vs-populate split, band/channel derivation, device naming, seen_via
    accumulation policy, and PCI<->full-identity promotion key derivation.

    It does not cover update_common_device / signal tracking (needs the packet
    chain), nor that add_related_device actually inserts both directions in the
    tracker -- pci_promotion() decides the two keys; it cannot observe the
    insert. Those still need a device-tree fixture.

    seen_via accumulation and promotion look tracker-bound, but only their
    mutation is; the decision is pure, and writing it down is what exposes the
    cross-RAT collision that test_promotion_keys_agree_across_rats pins.

 *
 * Real bridge output from an EG25-G capture carries no rsrp key on any
 * observation -- the modem's 0xB193 subpacket version (v18) has no grounded
 * RSRP scale, so the bridge deliberately emits identity only. Under a guard

 *
 * that is not "some rows dropped": every observation is dropped and no device
 * appears, while the datasource still reports itself running without errors.
 *
 * The fixture has only two distinct cell shapes (PCI 236 and PCI 471, both
 * EARFCN 2300), so it is used for exactly what it proves -- that an
 * identity-only observation still yields a key -- and the spec-derived cases
 * below cover the branches it cannot reach. Real data where it exists, honest
