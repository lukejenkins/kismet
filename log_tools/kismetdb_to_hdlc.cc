/* kismetdb_to_hdlc — reconstruct a celldiag source's raw DIAG HDLC byte stream
 * (the `rawlog=` tee) from the kismetdb `packets` table: the parse side of the
 * celldiag raw-packet emitter.
 *
 * Sibling of kismetdb_to_atlog. That tool rebuilds the AT lane's sidecar from
 * `data` rows; this one rebuilds the DIAG lane's from `packets` rows, so a
 * drive whose raw DIAG lives only in the .kismet can be processed exactly like
 * a drive that also wrote a rawlog= .hdlc sidecar.
 *
 * The input contract is capture_cell_diag/diag_rawpkt.h, and its constants are
 * included from there rather than restated. Each DLT-147 packet is a 24-byte
 * "CDRH" slice header (version, flags, header_len, session_id, offset), then a
 * slice of the stream exactly as read from the port. For one (datasource,
 * session_id), the slices sorted by `offset` and concatenated ARE the stream.
 * The header parse below repeats diag_rawpkt_parse()'s checks, but the tool
 * does not link diag_rawpkt.c: that object belongs to capture_cell_diag's own
 * sub-make, and building it here as well would put one object path under two
 * makefiles with different flags. The celltools test that replays through the
 * real emitter pins that the two agree.
 *
 * Order comes from `offset` only, never from rowid, packetid or the
 * timestamps. Kismet hands every celldiag packet to a random worker thread
 * (assignment_id 0), packetid is assigned inside that worker, and a remote
 * source's timestamps are overwritten on arrival. None of those follow the
 * order the source sent the packets in.
 *
 * What is selected: `packets` rows with dlt == DIAG_RAWPKT_DLT (--dlt) whose
 * datasource has `datasources.typestring == "celldiag"` (--type).
 *
 * What is written: one .hdlc per (source, session), the payloads concatenated
 * in offset order, with each header stripped (a header left in the stream
 * would glue itself onto the slice's first frame and cost that frame its CRC).
 * No deframing, no CRC check, no re-escaping: that is the DIAG decoder's
 * job (e.g. diaggrok).
 *
 * Integrity, from the offsets alone, per stream:
 *   gap       the next slice starts past the end of the last one. That many
 *             bytes were never delivered. Slices end on a 0x7E, so the missing
 *             bytes are whole frames and the frames around them still deframe.
 *   overlap   the next slice starts before the end of the last one. The slice
 *             is skipped; this should never happen.
 *   malformed a DLT-147 row that is not a valid v1 slice. The row is skipped.
 *   truncated a row stored shorter than packet_full_len.
 *   unaligned a slice not flagged FRAGMENT whose payload does not end in 0x7E
 *             (the contract says every such slice does).
 *   tail gap  the stream's END slice sits past the last delivered byte: that
 *             many trailing bytes were never delivered.
 *   bad END   END before the delivered data, or more than one END.
 *   drop row  a RawDiagDrop `data` row from the source for this session: it
 *             dropped slices, even if no gap shows them.
 *   abort row a RawDiagAbort `data` row the SERVER wrote for this session: the
 *             source died mid-stream (the helper's PING watchdog during a
 *             server stall, a crash), after data and before END, so an unknown
 *             tail -- up to its whole out-ring -- was lost with it.
 * Each is reported on stderr every time, not only with -v. --strict makes any
 * of them a failure (exit 3) before anything is written, which is what an
 * automated ingest wants. A replayed capture is lossless by design; a
 * live one can drop slices when the ring is full, and says so in a RawDiagDrop
 * row, in the source's messages and as a gap here.
 *
 * A gap needs a delivered slice AFTER it, so the offsets alone cannot show
 * slices dropped after the last delivered one: under a flood on a slow host,
 * the delivered slices can run contiguously from offset 0 while the tee holds
 * more than twice as many bytes, and an offsets-only reader would pass it under
 * --strict. Two witnesses close that (contract in diag_rawpkt.h):
 *   - END: a stream that reaches its teardown closes with an empty slice at its
 *     final length, so tail loss is an ordinary gap before it.
 *   - RawDiagDrop: the first drop is recorded as a `data` row, which is how a
 *     live drive stopped from Kismet without END (see below) still shows it
 *     lost its tail.
 * A stream with no END gets a NOTE that its end is unconfirmed -- and it may be
 * short: the read(s) in flight when the server closes the pipe are lost,
 * neither dropped (no RawDiagDrop row) nor ended. From an older helper without
 * the out-ring wakeup it is ~0.4-1 s short, stranded in the out-ring. With the
 * graceful close a Kismet-driven stop DOES end in END; none comes from a drive
 * recorded before it, a close that ran out of its grace, or
 * datasource_graceful_close=false. That is NOT a --strict failure -- it would
 * fail every older drive, and a gate that fails every drive gets switched off;
 * --require-end makes it one. A source that DIED mid-stream is different: the
 * server writes a RawDiagAbort row for it, and that IS refused.
 *
 * Exit status: 0 ok, 1 usage / input / ambiguity error, 2 no DIAG packets
 * (e.g. a drive from before the emitter existed, or rawpackets=off),
 * 3 --strict integrity failure.
 *
 * Deliberately opens the db READONLY and never VACUUMs/mutates it: a captured
 * .kismet is an artifact of record.
