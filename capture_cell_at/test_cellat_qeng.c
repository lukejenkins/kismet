    Selftest for the AT+QENG decode core.

    The anchor case is a real one: an RM520N-GL (RM520NGLAAR03A04M4G) parked on
    Verizon B66 reports RSSI -56 in its serving-cell response at fields[15]. A
    serving parser that never reads that field leaves every serving device at
    rssi=0 while the modem said -56.

    Every response string below is a VERBATIM line from a cellat transcript of
    that modem. Do not "tidy" them -- the "-" placeholders and the field counts
    are the parser's actual input.

    The free oracle: the same physical cell (PCI 221, EARFCN 66536) is reported
    by BOTH AT+QENG="servingcell" and AT+QENG="neighbourcell" in the same poll
    cycle, and the neighbour path decodes RSSI independently. So the two
    paths must agree on -56 -- that cross-check is what makes this a real
    regression test rather than a restatement of the implementation.
