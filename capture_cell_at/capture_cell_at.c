    Cell modem capture source for Kismet.

    Communicates with cellular modems via AT commands over serial ports,
    parses serving cell, neighbor cell, and network scan responses, and
    forwards cell observations as JSON to Kismet via cf_send_json()
    (type="Cell"/"CellModem"). It also emits every raw AT exchange into the
    kismetdb `data` table as type="RawAT" -- the same JSONL record the
    atlog= file tee writes -- so a Kismet drive's .kismet carries the full raw
    AT transcript inside it, read back by kismetdb_to_cellndjson.

    It also self-anchors its clock: at capture start,
    end and every clock_anchor_sec= seconds it issues AT+CCLK? and emits a
    type="ClockAnchor" row pairing the host clock with the modem RTC, so an
    AT-only drive (no DIAG ts64, no GNSS 0x1476) can still detect host<->modem
    clock skew from a single transport. AT+CCLK? is 3GPP TS 27.007, common to
    every vendor below, so the anchor is issued once in the shared poll loop
    rather than per driver. (The raw AT+CCLK? exchange also flows into atlog= and
    RawAT via the normal seam -- that raw reading is the primary dataset product;
    the ClockAnchor row is the structured layer.)

/* Report a fatal post-open condition so the operator actually sees the reason.
 * celldiag has the same helper.
 *
 * Do not "simplify" this to a bare cf_send_error(). Under the v3
 * protocol cf_send_error() is silently discarded by the server. There is no
 * `case KIS_EXTERNAL_V3_CMD_ERROR` in either dispatcher --
 * kis_external_interface::dispatch_rx_packet_v3 falls through to
 * kis_datasource::dispatch_rx_packet_v3, which also has no case for it, so the
 * frame this helper carefully serialised is dropped on the floor. From
 * kis_datasource.cc:1084:
 *
 *   // v3 drops explicit error/warning reports and rolls them into the return
 *   // codes of the packet headers itself.  The error message is sent as a
 *   // message prior to the packet being sent.
 *
 * "Sent as a message prior" is the prescribed idiom, and that is what the
 * cf_send_message() below is. It rides KIS_EXTERNAL_V3_CMD_MESSAGE, which the
 * server does handle.
 *
 * The symptom of a lost reason is worse here than in celldiag, which replays
 * a file and exits. cellat surveys forever: every one of the sites below is
 * inside the poll loop
 * and jumps to `done:`, where the source spins down and Kismet re-opens it 5 s
 * later. Without a delivered reason the operator sees an unbounded ladder of
 * `IPC connection closed` / `SOURCEERROR ... (N failures)` with the cause --
 * "failed to send JSON to Kismet", "serial error on serving cell query" --
 * discarded on every single iteration.
 *
 * Errors raised from open_callback do not belong here: they ride out on the
 * open report's return code, which is the idiom the comment above prescribes,
 * and routing them through this would double-report. cellat has no
 * cf_send_error() call in its open path and must not gain one; the asymmetry is
 * pinned by test_open_path_errors_do_not_use_the_message_channel.
 *
 * cf_send_error() is still called after the message: it is the protocol-correct
 * thing to emit, it is what a v2 peer would consume, and it is what puts the
 * source into the error state that drives Kismet's re-open. It just cannot be
 * relied on to carry the human-readable reason. */
