    cellat_lock -- band/RAT lock as the source's CHANNELS.

    The Wi-Fi source's channel buttons, Lock and Hop, for a cell modem. A
    channel is a named lock preset:

        AUTO        the modem's settings AS FOUND at open (the default)
        LTE         LTE only, every LTE band the modem had enabled
        NR5G        NR standalone only, every NR band it had enabled
        LTE-B<n>    LTE only, band n only
        NR-n<n>     NR SA only, band n only
        LTE-B<n>+<m>...   LTE only, exactly that SET of bands, e.g.
                    LTE-B2+4+12+66 -- one channel, so it is a Lock target and a
                    Hop list element like any preset. NR-n<n>+<m>... likewise.
                    Every band must be one the modem had enabled as found.
                    Not advertised as a preset (the sets are combinatorial):
                    set it by channel= or the set_channel route.

    Lock = Kismet's set_channel; Hop = Kismet's channel hop over a chosen list.
    Nothing is written to the modem until a channel other than AUTO is set.

    Every lever here is written to the modem's NV. A lock survives a reboot,
    so a modem must never be left locked:
      * the settings AS FOUND are saved to a host state file BEFORE the first
        write, and removed only after a restore succeeds;
      * the capture's teardown restores them;
      * the next open finds a state file a crashed session left and restores
        from it first, and then treats the FILE, not the modem, as the
        original settings, because the modem may still be locked.

    Backends, each PROBED at open and never asserted from the vendor name:

      QNWPREF  Quectel AT+QNWPREFCFG (RM500Q / RM520N-GL and siblings): RAT
               and the LTE / NR-SA band lists, so every channel above.
      SELRAT   Sierra AT!SELRAT=<index> (EM9190 / EM9291): RAT only.
               The index table differs by firmware -- "LTE Only" is 04 on
               01.07.19 and 06 on 03.17.04 -- so the LTE and NR indices are
               read BY NAME from AT!SELRAT=? at open, never from a table.
      QCFG     Quectel AT+QCFG (EG25-G and the EC2x/EG2x family, where
               QNWPREFCFG answers ERROR): RAT via "nwscanmode" (3 = LTE only)
               and ONE LTE band via "band". The GSM/WCDMA and TD-SCDMA fields
               are written as 0, which the QCFG manual V1.3 §5.4 defines as
               "no change", so only the LTE mask is ever touched; it is kept
               as bare hex, the form the manual writes back.
      WS46     3GPP AT+WS46=<n> (Telit LM960): RAT only. The codes come from
               AT+WS46=? (the LM960 offers 22,28,31): 28 = E-UTRAN only, 35 =
               NG-RAN only; AUTO is whatever was read.

    A RAT-only backend offers AUTO, LTE and (when the modem lists it) NR5G --
    no band channels. Other vendors' band commands are not wired up yet:
    Telit AT#BND needs a CFUN cycle and a 30 s read, and SIMCom CNMP has no
    captured write yet.

    Pure libc, so test_cellat_lock runs with no modem and no framework.
