    cellat QMI feed: the `qmifeed=<command>` source option.

    WHAT IT IS. QMI carries cell data AT cannot: the NR Cell Identity Telit's
    AT#RFSTS drops, and full cell identity on Sierra parts whose
    AT+CEREG / AT+CSQ return ERROR. qmifeed/kismet_qmi_feed.py, which
    ships in this directory (`qmifeed=auto` runs it), polls qmicli and writes one cell_observation JSON per stdout line, already in
    build_cell_json()'s shape with a {"src":"qmi",...} prov block. This unit
    spawns that command as a child of kismet_cap_cell_at and hands each complete
    line back to the capture loop, which forwards it as a `CellModem` record --
    the same record type the AT observations ride -- so phy_cell merges QMI, AT
    and DIAG sightings of one tower through prov.src with no server change.

    WHY A CHILD OF THE CAPTURE BINARY, not a datasource of its own. The Kismet
    server never reads NDJSON: a capture source speaks KDS over its IPC pipe.
    The capture child is the adapter, so the feed inherits cellat's source
    identity, its ModemIdentity record and its kismetdb rows for free.

    FD HYGIENE. The capture child's KDS IPC fds are NOT close-on-exec. A
    grandchild that inherited them would hold the server's pipe open after the
    capture child died, and the server -- which learns of a dead source from
    EOF -- would keep a zombie source forever. qmifeed_start() closes every fd
    >= 3 in the child before exec.

    STOPPING, IN LAYERS (because no single mechanism reaches every case):
      1. Kismet's own stop is a CLOSEREQ: the capture loop ends,
         teardown runs, and qmifeed_stop() kills the child's whole process
         group -- sh, python and any qmicli in flight.
      2. A capture child killed outright runs no teardown. PR_SET_PDEATHSIG
         then signals the DIRECT child only (it is not transitive).
      3. Everything deeper must notice for itself: a writer dies of SIGPIPE at
         its next line, and kismet_qmi_feed.py -- which may write nothing for
         a long time when no cell is in range -- also exits once its parent
         pid changes.
    The server's own reaper (capture_framework.c, waitpid(-1)) may collect
    the child before qmifeed_stop() does, so its exit status can be unknown.

    WHOSE CELLS THESE ARE. The feed stamps prov.imei with the
    IMEI its QMI device reports, not the one this source verified on its AT
    port, and cdc-wdm numbering on a multi-modem host is not stable. So:
      B. qmifeed_start() exports CELLAT_IMEI=<verified IMEI> to the child;
         kismet_qmi_feed.py picks the cdc-wdm whose DMS IMEI matches, or
         refuses to start.
      A. Every line is checked anyway (qmifeed_imei_check): a line stamped
         with another IMEI, or with none, is dropped, never relayed under
         this source. B prevents the mis-route; A is the backstop for any
         feed that does not honour B.

    A SECOND LINE TYPE. Besides `{...}` observations, qmifeed_start()
    exports CELLAT_QMIFEED_PROTO=2,
    and a feed that sees it may also write TAGGED lines:
        #rawqmi {json}          one raw qmicli exchange -> a `RawQMI` data row
        #msg info|error <text>  an operator note -> the Kismet message bus
    A feed that does not know the protocol never writes them, and a capture
    binary without a tag callback counts them as non-JSON, so either side can
    be older than the other. A raw record carries qmicli's text (and, with
    --qmilog-wire, the QMUX frames): ~10 KB, so lines may run to
    QMIFEED_RAW_MAX, while an observation line keeps the 4 KiB cap.

    Like clockanchor.c and cellat_options.c this is a libc-only translation unit
    (no Kismet, no serial), so the spawn / line framing / teardown are tested
    standalone in test_cellat_qmifeed.c (`make check` in this directory).
